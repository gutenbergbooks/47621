<h3><a name="pref" id="pref"></a>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="minimal" />

<p>The Translation of the following
Work was undertaken at the request
of Mr. <span class="smallcaps">Ruff</span>, the Publisher, who
wished me to paraphrase what I
thought might more particularly
interest and edify the English
reader.</p>

<p>It is dedicated, by the Publisher,
to her Grace the <span class="smalcapsw">Duchess of
Bedford</span>&mdash;and he is anxious that
it may be found worthy of her
patronage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>The original French work was
first published in 1688; and the
earliest English translation appeared
in 1707. This translation, which
was by Dr. Hickes, I have never
seen. In the year 1797, another
[anonymous] English translation
was printed at Hull, in a duodecimo
volume. In this performance
there is so close an adherence to
the idiom of the French language,
that almost every page abounds
with gallicisms. It is not, however,
entirely destitute of merit; but it
appears, on the whole, to have
been hastily executed for the purpose
of ensuring a cheap and
extensive sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>The present translation is offered
to the public, with a full conviction
of its inadequacy to give a just idea
of the beauty and force of the original.
The author of "<i>Telemaque</i>"
and "<i>De l'Education des Filles</i>"
appears, on a comparison of these
two performances, very unlike the
same writer. In the former, his
periods are flowing and luxuriant;
in the latter, they are sententious
and logical; and nearly as difficult
to clothe in an English-dress
as those of the philosophical
Tacitus.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that
a literal translation has not been
attempted; and a still greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
deviation will be observable, from
a wish to distinguish it from the
translation of 1797. Whether
this has always been done for the
better, the reader will determine
for himself.</p>

<p>The <i>Original Chapter</i> "<span class="smalcapsw">on religious
studies</span>" has been submitted
to those, whose opinions, matured
by experience, I have been anxious
to obtain; and it has received the
sanction of their approbation.</p>

<p>If the Work fail of success, it
will not be from the want of spirit
in the Publisher; for it is accompanied
with considerable beauty of
type and paper, and elegance of
ornament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>The <i>design</i> is every way worthy
of the ingenious artist by whom it
was executed, and who has long
been known to the world from the
taste and fidelity of his pencil.
The engraving, by Mr. Freeman,
will convince the public that he
requires only to be known, to be
more generally encouraged.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_I" id="ch_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>On the Importance of the Education of<br />
Daughters.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>The Education of Girls is, in
general, exceedingly neglected:<a name="fnr_1" id="fnr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><sup><span class="small">1</span></sup></a>
custom, and maternal caprice, often
appear to have the entire regulation
of it. It absolutely seems as if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>supposed the sex to be in need of
little or no instruction. On the
other hand, the Education of <i>Boys</i>
is considered as a very important
concern, affecting the welfare of
the public; and although it be
frequently attended with errors and
mistakes, great abilities are nevertheless
thought necessary for the
accomplishment of it. The brightest
talents have been engaged to form
plans and modes of instruction:&mdash;What
numbers of masters and colleges
do we behold? What expences
incurred in the printing of books,
in researches after science, in modes
of teaching languages, in the establishment
of professors? All these
grand preparations may probably
have more shew than substance, but
they sufficiently denote the high
idea we entertain of the education
of Boys. In regard to Girls, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>exclaim, "why make them learned?
curiosity renders them vain and
conceited: it is sufficient if they be
one day able to govern their families,
and implicitly obey their husbands!"
Examples are then adduced of many
women whom science has rendered
ridiculous; and on such contemptible
authority we think ourselves
justified in blindly abandoning our
daughters to the conduct of ignorant
and indiscreet mothers.</p>

<p>It is true, that we should be on
our guard not to make them ridiculously
learned. Women, in general,
possess a weaker but more inquisitive
mind than men; hence it follows
that their pursuits should be of a
quiet and sober turn. They are not
formed to govern the state, to make
war, or to enter into the church; so
that they may well dispense with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>any profound knowledge relating to
politics, military tactics, philosophy,
and theology. The greater part of
the mechanical arts are also improper
for them: they are made for moderate
exercise; their bodies as well
as minds are less strong and energetic
than those of men; but to compensate
for their defects, nature has
bestowed on them a spirit of industry,
united with a propriety of
behaviour, and an economy which
renders them at once the ornament
and comfort of home.<a name="fnr_2" id="fnr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><sup><span class="small">2</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>But admitting that women are by
nature weaker than men, what is the
consequence? What, but that the
weaker they are, the more they stand
in need of support. Have they not
duties to perform, which are the
very foundation of human existence?
Consider, it is women who ruin or
uphold families; who regulate the
<i>minuti&aelig;</i> of domestic affairs; and
who consequently decide upon some
of the dearest and tenderest points
which affect the happiness of Man.
They have undoubtedly the strongest
influence on the manners, good
or bad, of society. A sensible woman,
who is industrious and religious,
is the very soul of a large establishment,
and provides both for
its temporal and eternal welfare.
Notwithstanding the authority of
men in public affairs, it is evident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>that they cannot effect any lasting
good, without the intervention and
support of women.</p>

<p>The <i>world</i> is not a phantom, it is
<i>the aggregate of all its families</i>; and
who can civilize and govern these
with a nicer discrimination than
women? besides their natural assiduity
and authority at home, they
are peculiarly calculated for it, by a
carefulness, attention to particulars,
industry, and a soft and persuasive
manner. Can men promise themselves
any felicity in this life, if
marriage, the very essence of domestic
society, be productive of
bitterness and disappointment? and
as to children, who are to constitute
the future generation, to what misery
will <i>they</i> be exposed, if their mothers
ruin them from the cradle?</p>

<p>Such then, are the occupations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>the female sex, which cannot be
deemed of less importance to society
than those of the male. It appears
that they have a house and establishment
to regulate, a husband to make
happy, and children to rear. Virtue
is as necessary for men as for women;
and without entering upon the comparative
good or ill which society
experiences from the latter sex, it
must be remembered that they are
<i>one half of the human race</i>, <span class="smallcaps">redeemed
by the blood of Jesus Christ,
and destined to life eternal</span>.</p>

<p>Lastly, let us not forget that if
women do great good to the community
when well educated, they
are capable of infinite mischief when
viciously instructed. It is certain
that a bad education works less ill
in a male, than in a female breast;
for the vices of men often proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>from the bad education which their
mothers have given them, and from
passions which have been instilled
into them at a riper age, from casual
intercourse with women.</p>

<p>What intrigues does history present
to us&mdash;what subversion of laws
and manners&mdash;what bloody wars&mdash;what
innovations in religion&mdash;what
revolutions in states&mdash;all arising
from the irregularities of women?
Ought not these considerations to
impress us with the importance of
female education? Let us, therefore,
discuss the various means of accomplishing
so desirable an object.</p>

<p class="med"><a name="fn_1" id="fn_1"></a><a href="#fnr_1">1.</a> It must be remembered that the above sentiment
was expressed in the year 1688, when the want of a good
system of female education was universally felt and regretted.
At the present day, we witness a noble reverse
of things; and whatever theories may have, been proposed
abroad, we can never cease to admire the labours,
and applaud the sagacity, of <i>our</i> countrywomen in behalf
of their sex.</p>

<p class="med"><a name="fn_2" id="fn_2"></a><a href="#fnr_2">2.</a> This idea is beautifully expressed in the following
lines of <span class="smallcaps">Thomson</span>:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="ch_II" id="ch_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Errors in the Ordinary Mode of Education.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>Ignorance is one of the causes of
the <i>ennui</i> and discontent of young
persons, and of the absence of all
rational amusement. When a child
has arrived at a certain age without
having applied to solid pursuits, she
can have neither taste nor relish for
them. Every thing which is serious
assumes to her mind a sorrowful
appearance; and that which requires
a continued attention, wearies and
disgusts her. The natural inclination
to pleasure, which is strong in
youth&mdash;the example of young people
of the same age, plunged in dissipation&mdash;every
thing, in short, serves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>to excite a dread of an orderly and
industrious life. In this early age,
she wants both experience and authority
to take a decided part in the
management of household affairs;
she is even ignorant of the important
consequences resulting from it,
unless her mother has previously
instructed her in some of its departments.
If she be born to affluence,
she is not necessitated to undergo
manual toil: she may probably
work an hour or two a day, because
she hears it said, without knowing
why, that "it is proper for women
to work"&mdash;but this pithy proverb
will only produce the semblance,
without the substance, of real useful
application.</p>

<p>In such a situation what is she to
do? The society of a mother, who
narrowly watches, scolds, and thinks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>she is performing her duty in not
overlooking the least fault&mdash;who is
never satisfied, but always trying the
temper, and appears herself immersed
in domestic cares; all this disgusts
and torments her. She is, moreover,
surrounded with flattering servants,
who, seeking to insinuate themselves,
by base and dangerous compliances,
gratify all her fancies, and
direct her conversation to every
topic but that of goodness and
virtue. To her, piety appears an
irksome task&mdash;a foe to every rational
amusement. What, then, are her
occupations? None that are useful.
Hence arises a habit of indolence,
which at length becomes incurable.</p>

<p>Meantime what is to fill this
vacuity? Nothing but the most frivolous
and contemptible pursuits.
In such a state of lassitude, a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>woman abandons herself to pure
idleness; and idleness, which may
be termed a languor of the soul, is
an inexhaustible source of weariness
and discontent. She sleeps one-third
more than is necessary to preserve
her health: this protracted slumber
serves only to enervate and render
her more delicate; more exposed to
the turbulency of passion; whereas
moderate sleep, accompanied with
regular exercise, produces that
cheerfulness, vigour, and elasticity
of spirits, which form, perhaps, the
true criterion of bodily and mental
perfection.</p>

<p>This weariness and idleness, united
with ignorance, beget a pernicious
eagerness for public diversions;
hence arises a spirit of curiosity, as
indiscreet as it is insatiable.</p>

<p>Those who are instructed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>busied in serious employments, have,
in general, but a moderate curiosity.
What they know gives them an indifference
for many things of which
they are ignorant; and convinces
them of the inutility and absurdity
of those things, with which narrow
minds, that know nothing, and have
nothing to exercise themselves upon,
are extremely desirous of becoming
acquainted.</p>

<p>On the contrary, young women,
without instruction and application,
have always a roving imagination.
In want of substantial employment,
their curiosity hurries them
on to vain and dangerous pursuits.
Those who have somewhat more
vivacity, pique themselves on a superior
knowledge, and read, with avidity,
every book which flatters their
vanity: they become enamoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>of novels, plays, and "Tales of
Wonder," in which love and licentiousness
predominate: they fill
their minds with visionary notions,
by accustoming themselves to the
splendid sentiments of heroes of
romance, and hence are rendered
unfit for the common intercourse of
society; for all these fine airy sentiments,
these generous passions, these
adventures, which the authors of
romance have invented for mere
amusement, have no connexion with
the real motives which agitate mankind,
and direct the affairs of the
world; nor with those disappointments
which usually accompany
us in almost every thing we undertake.</p>

<p>A poor girl, full of the tender and
the marvellous, which have delighted
her in her reading, is astonished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>not to find in the world real personages,
resembling the heroes she
has read of&mdash;fain would she live like
those imaginary princesses, whom
fiction has described as always
charming, always adored, and always
beyond the reach of want. What
disgust must she feel on descending
from such a state of heroism, to the
lowest offices of housewifery!</p>

<p>Some there are who push their
curiosity still further, and without
the least qualifications, presume to
decide upon theological points.&mdash;But
those who have not sufficient
grasp of intellect for these curiosities,
have other pursuits, better proportioned
to their talents: they are
extremely desirous of knowing what
is said, and going on in the world&mdash;a
song&mdash;news&mdash;an intrigue&mdash;to receive
letters, and to read those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>that other people receive; these
things delight prodigiously; they
wish every thing to be told them,
and to tell every thing in turn: they
are vain, and vanity is a sure incentive
to talk. They become giddy,
and volatility prevents those reflections
from rising which would shew
them the value of silence.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Of the First Foundations of Education.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>To remedy the evils just complained
of, it is of material consequence
to commence a system of
education from <i>Infancy</i>: this tender
period, which is too often intrusted
to imprudent and irregular women,
is, in truth, the most susceptible of
the strongest impressions, and consequently
has a great influence on
the future regulation of life.</p>

<p>As soon as children can lisp, they
may be prepared for instruction:
this may be thought paradoxical&mdash;but
only consider what a child does
before it can talk. It is learning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>a language which it will, by and
by, speak with more accuracy, than
the learned can speak the dead
languages, although studied at a
mature period of life. But what
is the learning a language? It does
not consist solely in treasuring in
the memory a great number of
words&mdash;but in comprehending, says
St. Austin, the meaning of each particular
word: the child, amidst its
cries and amusements, knows for
what object each word is designed:
this is obtained sometimes by observing
the natural motions of
bodies which touch, or shew, the
objects of which one is speaking&mdash;sometimes
by being struck with the
frequent repetition of the same word
to signify the same thing. It cannot
be denied but that the brain of
children is admirably calculated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>from its temperament, to receive
impressions from all these images;
but what strength of mental attention
is requisite to distinguish them,
and to unite each to its proper
object?</p>

<p>Consider too, how children, even
at such a tender age, attach themselves
to those who flatter, and
avoid those who restrain, them:
how well they know to obtain
their object by a tear, or silent submission:
how much artifice and
jealousy they already possess! "I
have seen," exclaims St. Austin, "a
jealous child: it could not speak;
but its face was pale, and the eyes
were irritated against an infant that
suckled with it."</p>

<p>From this it may be inferred, that
infants know more at such an early
period than is usually imagined:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>thus, by soft words and appropriate
gestures, you may incline them
towards honest and virtuous connexions,
rather than introduce them
to those which it would be dangerous
for them to caress.&mdash;Thus, again,
you may, by appropriate looks and
tone of voice, represent to them,
with horror, those whom they have
seen exasperated with anger, or any
other furious passion; and, on the
other hand, by a correspondent serenity
of manner, depicture to them
those who are amiable and wise.</p>

<p>I do not wish to lay too great a
stress on these subordinate matters:
but, in reality, these different dispositions
form a commencement of
character which must not be neglected;
and this mode of foreseeing,
as it were, the future dispositions
of children, has imperceptible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>consequences which facilitate their
education.</p>

<p>If we still doubt of the power of
these early prepossessions on future
maturity, we need only call to mind
how lively and affecting, at an
advanced age, is the remembrance
of those things which have delighted
us in childhood. If, instead of terrifying
the minds of young people
with absurd notions of ghosts and
spirits, which serve only to weaken
and disturb the still delicate texture
of the brain: if, instead of abandoning
them to the caprice of a nurse
for what they are to like or dislike,
we endeavoured always to impress
on their minds an agreeable idea of
good, and a frightful one of evil&mdash;this
foresight might hereafter be the
foundation of every practical virtue.
On the contrary, we frighten them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>with the idea of a clergyman clothed
in black&mdash;we talk of death merely
to excite terror&mdash;and recount tales
of the dead revisiting the earth, at
midnight, under hideous shapes!
All this has a tendency to weaken
and agitate the mind, and to excite
a prejudice against the soundest
doctrines.</p>

<p>One of the most useful and important
things during infancy is, to
be particularly careful of the child's
health; endeavouring to sweeten
the blood by a proper choice of
food, and a simple regimen of life:
regulating its meals, so that it eat
pretty nearly at the same hours, and
as it feels the inclination; that the
stomach be not overloaded before
digestion takes place, and that no
high-seasoned dishes be introduced,
which must necessarily give a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>disrelish for more healthful food.
Lastly, too many dishes should not
be allowed at the same time; for
such a variety of food begets an
appetite even after the real call of
hunger is satisfied.</p>

<p>Another very important consideration
is, not to oppress the faculties
by too much instruction; to avoid
every thing which may kindle the
passions; to deprive a child, gently
and by degrees, of that for which it
has expressed too vehement a desire
to obtain; so that, eventually, it may
be insensible of disappointment.</p>

<p>If a child's disposition be tolerably
good, it may, by the foregoing
method, be rendered docile, patient,
steady, cheerful, and tranquil;
whereas, if its tender years be neglected,
it becomes restless and turbulent
during the remainder of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>life; the blood boils, bad habits are
formed, and the body and mind,
both equally susceptible, become
prone to evil. Hence arises a sort
of second original sin, which, in
advanced age, is the source of a
thousand disorders.</p>

<p>As soon as children arrive at a
more mature period, or their reason
becomes unfolded, we must be
careful that all our words have a
tendency to make them love truth,
and detest artifice and hypocrisy.
We ought never to be guilty of any
deception or falsehood to appease
them, or to persuade them to comply
with our wishes: if we are, we instruct
them in cunning and artifice;
and this they never forget. Reason
and good sense must be our instruments
of regulation.</p>

<p>But let us examine with a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>more attention the exact dispositions
of children, and what more
particularly regards their treatment.
The substance of their brain is soft,
but it becomes harder every day: it
has neither experience nor judgment
to discriminate one object from
another, and every thing is, therefore,
new to them. From this softness
and pliability of the brain,
impressions are easily made; and
the surprize which accompanies
novelty, is the cause of their continual
admiration, and extreme
curiosity. It is true that this ductility
of the brain, attended with considerable
heat, produces an easy and
constant motion; hence arises that
bustle and volatility of youth, which
is as incapable of fixing the attention
on one object, as it is of confining
the body to one spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Again, children are incapable of
thinking and acting for themselves;
they remark every thing, but speak
little; unless they have been accustomed
to talk much&mdash;an evil, against
which we must be constantly on
our guard. The pleasure which we
derive and express from the sight of
<i>pretty children</i>, spoils them; for they
are, in consequence, accustomed to
utter every thing which comes
uppermost, and to talk on subjects
of which they have no distinct ideas;
hence is formed an habit of precipitately
passing judgment, and of
discussing points they are incapable
of comprehending; an unfortunate
circumstance! and which, probably,
adheres to them through life.</p>

<p>This admiration of <i>pretty children</i>
has another pernicious consequence;
they are sensible that you look at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>them, watch all their actions, and
listen to their prattle, with pleasure&mdash;hence
they flatter themselves that
all the world must follow your
example.</p>

<p>During this period, when applause
is perpetually bestowed, and contradiction
seldom obtruded, children
indulge chimerical hopes, which,
alas! are the source of endless disappointments
throughout life. I
have seen children who always
fancied you were talking about
them, whenever any thing was privately
said&mdash;and this, forsooth, because
it has <i>sometimes</i> actually been
the case: they have also imagined
themselves to be most extraordinary
and incomparable beings. Take
care, therefore, that in your attentions
to children, they are unconscious
of any particular solicitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>on your part: shew them that it is
from pure regard, and the helplessness
of their condition to relieve
their own wants, that you interest
yourself in their behalf&mdash;and not
from admiration of their talents.
Be content to form their minds, by
degrees, according to each emergency
that may arise: and if it were
in your power to advance their
knowledge much beyond their years,
even without straining their intellect,
by no means put it in practice;
recollect that the danger of <i>vanity</i>
and <i>arrogance</i> is always greater than
the fruit of those premature educations
which make so much noise in
the world.</p>

<p>We must be satisfied to follow
and assist nature. Children know
little, and should not be stimulated
to talk: but the consequence of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>ignorance is, they are continually
asking questions. We should, therefore,
answer them precisely, and
add sometimes little comparisons,
which may throw light on the
information we give them. If they
judge of some things without sufficient
knowledge, they should be
checked by a new question, which
might make them sensible of their
error without rudely confounding
them; at the same time take care
to impress on their minds, not by
vague praises, but by some effectual
mark of esteem, that they afford
much more satisfaction when they
<i>doubt</i>, and <i>ask for information</i>, on
points they do not know, than when
they happen to decide rightly.
This is the sure method to implant
in them a true sense of modesty and
politeness; and to excite a contempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>for those idle controversies in which
ignorant young folks are too apt to
indulge.</p>

<p>As soon as we begin to watch the
dawn of reason spreading, we should
seize it as a favourable opportunity
to guard them against presumption:
"You see," we should exclaim, "that
you are much more reasonable and
tractable than you were last year&mdash;and
in the <i>following</i> year you will
observe things yet more clearly than
you do at present&mdash;if, during the
last year, you were eager to have
passed judgment on things which
you now know, and were then
ignorant of, you would assuredly
have judged wrong. You would
therefore have been to blame in
offering opinions on subjects above
the reach of your intellect. There
are, at this moment, many things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>which remain for you to know; and
you will one day be convinced how
imperfect are your <i>present</i> conceptions.
Nevertheless, adhere to the
counsel of those who judge of
things as you yourself would judge,
were you gifted with their years and
experience."</p>

<p>As the curiosity of children is a
faculty which precedes instruction,
we should be careful to make them
profit by it. For example, in the
country when they see a mill, they
wish to know what it is&mdash;here, then,
you may shew them how that food
is prepared which nourishes man.
A little further they perceive
reapers&mdash;and you must explain to
them their occupation; how they
sow the grain, and how it multiplies
in the earth. In the town they see
a number of shops, where various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>trades are exercised, and various
merchandize is sold. Never consider
their questions as importunate;
they are overtures which nature
makes to facilitate instruction&mdash;shew
them, therefore, that you take
pleasure in these questions&mdash;for, by
such means, you teach them insensibly
how every thing is made,
which conduces to the comfort of
man, and extension of commerce.
By degrees, and without any particular
study, they become acquainted
with every article that is useful,
and with the price affixed to each,
which is, indeed, the true foundation
of economy. This kind of
knowledge, which no one should
despise, because no one is willing to
be cheated from the want of it, is
particularly necessary for women.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>The Danger of Imitation.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>The ignorance of children, (in
whose brain no correct impressions
are made,) renders them extremely
susceptible, and inclined to imitate
every thing they see. It is, therefore,
of consequence to set before
them none but the very best models
of imitation; and to make them
acquainted with those, by whose
examples they would be profited in
following. But as it happens, in
spite of all our precautions, that
they occasionally witness many
irregularities, we must not fail to
warn them betimes against the
impertinence of certain foolish and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>dissipated people, whose reputation
is scarcely worth preserving: we
must shew them how truly miserable
and deserving of contempt, are
those who abandon themselves to
passion, without cultivating their
reason. One may also give them,
a correct taste, free from affectation,
and make them sensible of
the true value of modesty and
decorum; we must not even abstain
from guarding them against probable
errors, although by this means
we may open their eyes to certain
defects in those whom they are
taught to respect. We have neither
right nor reason to hope that they
will remain ignorant on such points,
and therefore the best method to
pursue, in order to keep them to
their duty, is, to persuade them
to bear with the faults of others;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>not to pass too severe a sentence on
them, as they often appear greater
than they really are&mdash;that they are
even compensated for by many good
qualifications&mdash;and that as there is
no perfection in this world, they
should admire that which approaches
the nearest towards it.
Lastly, although this advice should
not be offered but in extreme cases,
we should, nevertheless, engraft on
them <i>true principles</i>, and preserve
them from imitating all the evil
that is set before them.</p>

<p>We must also be on our guard to
prevent their imitation of <i>ridiculous
people</i>; whose low and buffoon-like
manners have something in them
extremely revolting to noble and
generous sentiments; we should
be apprehensive lest children afterwards
assume these very manners;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>as the warmth of their imagination,
and pliability of body, added to the
pleasure they seem to take in such
diversion, gives them a peculiar
aptitude to represent every ridiculous
object they behold.</p>

<p>This proneness to imitation,
which is natural to children, is the
source of infinite mischief when
they are delivered up to improper
people who are hardly able to
restrain themselves before them.
But providence has ordained this
imitative power, that children may
be also capable of applying themselves
to what is good and virtuous.
Often, without speaking to them,
we have only to <i>shew</i> them in
others what we would have them
do themselves.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_V" id="ch_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Indirect Instructions: we should not be too<br />
urgent with Children.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>I think we should often make use
of <i>indirect</i> instructions, which are
not so tedious and uninteresting as
lessons and remonstrances, in order
to excite their attention to certain
examples which are placed before
them.</p>

<p>A person may sometimes ask
another, in their presence, "Why
do you do so"&mdash;and the other may
answer&mdash;"I do it for such a reason."
For example&mdash;"Why did you confess
your fault?" "Because I should
have been guilty of a much greater
one by disavowing it with a lye"&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>because nothing is more praiseworthy
than to say frankly, "I am
wrong." Then the first person should
commend the one who has thus
accused herself&mdash;but care must be
taken that all this be done without
art or affectation, for children have
much more penetration than we are
aware of&mdash;and as soon as they discover
any finesse in their teachers,
they lose that simplicity and confidence
which is natural to their
character.</p>

<p>We have before observed that
the brain of children, from being
at the same time moist and warm,
produces continual motion. This
softness or pliancy of the brain
causes impressions to be easily
made, and images of every sensible
object to be vividly and strongly
imprinted; hence we should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>anxious to engrave, as it were, on
their minds such characters as are
easily formed. But great care
must be shewn in the selection of
such objects as we wish to impress:
for in so small and precious a
cabinet, none but the most exquisite
furniture should be admitted. Let
it be remembered, that at such a
tender age, no knowledge should be
engrafted but such as we wish to
remain there for life. The first
impressions that are made, when the
brain is so soft and susceptible, are
in general the most durable; and
in proportion as age hardens the
brain, do such impressions become
indelible. Hence it is, that in old
age we remember distinctly the
images of youth, however remote;
whereas as age advances we have a
fainter recollection of such things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>as we progressively behold, because
the impression has been made on
the brain when it is gradually
hardening, and filled with other
images.</p>

<p>Although we understand how to
reason in this manner, we have some
difficulty in acceding to it: and yet
we absolutely do make use of this
very mode of reasoning. For instance,
do we not say every day,
"My habits are fixed, I am too old to
change them, I have been brought
up in this way."&mdash;Moreover are we
not conscious of a singular pleasure
in recalling to mind the images of
youth? are not the strongest propensities
formed at that age? Does
not, therefore, all this prove that
the first impressions and first habits
are the strongest? If infancy be the
fittest period for engraving such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>images on the brain, it must be
allowed that it is the least so for the
cultivation of reason. That ductility
of the brain which causes impressions
to be easily formed, being
united with extreme heat, produces
an agitation which sets all regular
application at defiance.</p>

<p>The brain of children may be
compared to a lighted wax taper,
situated in a place which is exposed
to the wind&mdash;its flame is perpetually
flickering. A child asks you a question,
and before you can answer, its
eyes are directed towards the cieling:
it counts all the figures that are
carved there, or all the bits of glass
which compose the window: if you
wish to bring it back to the first subject
of discussion, you vex it as much
as if you confined it in prison. Thus
great care is required in managing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>the organs before they assume a determined
inclination: answer every
question promptly, and leave the
child to put others as it pleases.
Gratify only the curiosity which it
evinces, and lay up in the memory
a mass of sound materials. The
time will come, when these impressions
will be regularly arranged,
and the brain having more consistency,
the child will reason on the
consequences. Nevertheless, be attentive
to correct when the reasoning
is fallacious; and to convince
it, without embarrassment, as an
opportunity offers, in what a wrong
consequence consists.</p>

<p>Let a child amuse itself freely,
and mingle instruction with amusement:
let wisdom be introduced at
proper intervals, and under an
agreeable form; and take care not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>to fatigue it by a precision which is
both formal and injudicious.</p>

<p>If a child entertains sad and dismal
notions of virtue, if liberty and
irregularity present themselves in a
seducing manner, every thing is
lost, and your labour is in vain.
Never suffer it to be flattered by
little contemptible associates, or
people without character or worth:
we naturally love the manners and
sentiments of those whom we regard;
and the pleasure which is
sometimes taken in the company of
disreputable people, begets, by degrees,
a love of those pernicious
habits which renders <i>them</i> so truly
contemptible.</p>

<p>In order to conciliate children to
people of real estimable character,
make them reflect on their excellence
and utility, their sincerity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>their modesty, their disinterestedness,
their fidelity, their discretion,
but above all their <i>piety</i>, which is
the foundation of the rest.</p>

<p>If a child has any thing about it
revolting or offensive, you must
observe to it that "piety does not
produce such defects: when it is
perfect, it destroys, or at least
softens them." But, after all, we
must not persist in making children
admire certain pious characters
whose exterior deportment is disgusting.</p>

<p>Although you are particularly
anxious to regulate your own conduct
with the utmost circumspection
and nicety, do not imagine
that children will fancy you faultless:
oftentimes your slightest imperfections
will be noticed by
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>St. Austin informs us that he had
remarked, from his infancy, the
vanity of his tutors. The best and
most politic thing you can do, is,
to know your own faults as completely
as a child will know them,
and to request some real friend to
warn you of them. The generality
of instructors pardon nothing in
a pupil, but every thing in themselves:
this excites an inquisitive
and watchful spirit of malignity
in such pupils&mdash;so that whenever
they detect any fault in their tutor,
they are delighted, and eventually
despise him.</p>

<p>Shun this error: do not be afraid
to mention the faults which are
visible in your conduct, and which
may have escaped you before the
child. If you find her capable of
reasoning thereupon, observe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>you set her an example of correcting
her faults, by the detection of your
own&mdash;by this means, your imperfections
will be instrumental in
edifying the child, and encouraging
her to correct herself. You will also
thereby avoid the contempt and
disgust which your own faults may
cause her to entertain against your
person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, try every method to
make those things agreeable which
you exact from a child. Have you
any thing crabbed or difficult to
propose? convince her that this
pain will be succeeded by pleasure:
always shew the utility which
results from your instructions; and
make her sensible of the consequences
as affecting mankind, and
the different orders of society. Without
this, all study will appear as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>dry, barren, and thorny path. "Of
what use," will children sometimes
say to themselves, "is it to learn
those things which do not relate to
ordinary conversation, and which
have no immediate connection with
what we are <i>obliged</i> to do?"</p>

<p>We should therefore give them
a reason for every thing we teach&mdash;"It
is, we should observe, to enable
you one day to do well in the
world&mdash;it is to form your judgment,
and to make you reason well
on all the affairs of life." We
should always represent to them
some useful and solid <i>end</i>, which
may support them in their application:
and never pretend to keep
them in subjection by a crabbed
and absolute authority.</p>

<p>In proportion as their reason
advances, we should discuss with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>them on the necessity of education;
not that we should implicitly follow
their thoughts, but profit by them
when they discover their real state
of mind: so that we may try their
discernment, and make them relish
those things we are anxious for
them to learn.</p>

<p>Never assume, without urgent
necessity, an austere and imperious
manner, which only causes children
to tremble, and savours strongly of
affectation and pedantry in those
who govern: children are, for the
greater part, timid and diffident.
By such means you shut out all
access to the heart, and deprive
them of a confidence, without
which no benefit can be derived
from instruction. Make yourself
beloved: let them be free with
you, so that they fear nothing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>discovering their faults. In order
to attain this, be indulgent to those
who do not disguise themselves
before you. Appear neither astonished
nor irritated at their bad
propensities: on the contrary, bear
with their foibles. This inconvenience
may, however, sometimes
arise, that they will be less intimidated;
but, taking all things
together, confidence and sincerity
is of far greater utility than a rigorous
discipline.</p>

<p>Besides, authority will lose its
proper effect, if confidence and
persuasion are not equally strong.
Always commence with an open
and candid manner; be cheerful
and familiar without vulgarity,
which enables you to see children
conduct themselves in a perfectly
natural state, and to know their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>inmost character. If even you
should succeed in all your plans by
the force of authority alone, you
will not gain the proper end: you
will disgust them in their search
after goodness, of which you ought
solely to endeavour to inspire them
with admiration.</p>

<p>If the wisest man has recommended
parents to hold the rod
continually over the heads of their
children, if he has said that a father
who "spareth his child" will repent
it hereafter&mdash;it does not follow that
he has censured a mild and lenient
mode of education. He only condemns
those weak and inconsiderate
parents who flatter the passions of
their children, and who only strive
to divert them in their infancy, so
that they are guilty of all sorts of
excess. The proper conclusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>seems to be that parents ought to
preserve authority sufficient for
correction; for there are some dispositions
which require to be subdued
by fear alone; but let it be
remembered that this should never
be enforced unless every other
expedient has been previously
applied.</p>

<p>A child who merely follows the
capricious impulse of imagination,
and who confounds every thing
which presents itself to her mind,
detests application and virtue, because
she has taken a prejudice
against the person who speaks to
her concerning them.</p>

<p>Hence arises that dismal and
frightful idea of religion, which she
preserves all her life: and which, alas!
is often the only wretched remnant
of a severe system of education. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>must frequently tolerate many
things which are deserving of
immediate punishment, and wait
for the opportunity when the feelings
of a child dispose it to profit
by correction.</p>

<p>Never rebuke a child in the first
moments of passion, whether on
your side or hers. If on yours, she
will perceive that, you conduct
yourself according to caprice and
resentment, and not according to
reason and affection: you will, in
consequence, irretrievably lose your
authority. If you correct in the
first gust of her passion, her mind is
not sufficiently collected to confess
her fault, to conquer her feelings,
and to acknowledge the importance
of your advice: such a mode may
even hazard your pupil's respect
for you. Always let the child see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>you are mistress of your own feelings;
and nothing can effect this
so much as <i>patience</i>. Watch every
moment, each day, when correction
may be well-timed. Never tell her
of a fault, without, at the same
time, suggesting some mode of
redressing it, which will induce her
to put it in practice; for nothing
is more to be avoided than that
chagrin and discouragement which
are the consequence of mere formal
correction. If a child is discovered
to be a little rational, I think you
should win it insensibly to <i>wish</i> to
have its faults disclosed, as this
would be the way of making it
sensible of them, without causing
affliction: never, however, recount
too many faults at a time.</p>

<p>We should consider that children
have a tender intellect, that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>age makes them susceptible chiefly
of pleasure, and that we often expect
from them a correctness and
seriousness of deportment, which
their instructors are sometimes incapable
of evincing. A very dangerous
impression of <i>ennui</i> and
sadness is produced on their mind,
by perpetually talking to them of
words and things which they do
not understand: no liberty, no
amusement! always lesson, silence,
constraint, correction, and threats!</p>

<p>Our ancient forefathers knew
better. It was by the charm of
verses and music that the Hebrews,
Egyptians, and Greeks, introduced
the principal sciences, the maxims
of virtue, and the politeness of
manners. Without reading, people
scarcely believe these things, so distant
are they from present custom!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>nevertheless, little as history is
known, there is not a doubt but that
this was the common practice for
many centuries. However, let us so
far correct our own age, as to unite
the agreeable and the useful together,
as much as lay in our power.</p>

<p>But although we can hardly
hope to lay aside <i>awe</i> with the
generality of children, whose dispositions
are headstrong and untractable,
we should, nevertheless,
not have recourse to it without
having patiently tried every other
experiment. We should even make
them distinctly understand the extent
of our demands, allowing a
certain medium with which we
should be satisfied: for good-humour
and confidence should be their
natural disposition&mdash;otherwise we
damp their spirit, and daunt their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>courage: if they are lively, we irritate;
if dull, we stupify them.&mdash;Fear
may be compared to violent
remedies employed in extreme
cases&mdash;they purge, but they alter
the temperament, and reduce the
organs to extremity. A mind
governed by fear, is generally the
weaker for it.</p>

<p>We should not always menace
without chastising, for fear of rendering
menace of no avail; but we
should menace more frequently
than we chastise. As to chastisement,
the pain inflicted ought to
be as slight as possible&mdash;but accompanied
with every circumstance
which can prick the child with
shame and remorse. For example,
shew her every thing you have
done to avoid coming to this unpleasant
extremity&mdash;appear to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>even affected at it&mdash;speak to her,
in the presence of others, of the
melancholy state of those whose
want of reason and good conduct
have forced correction upon them;
and keep back the ordinary marks
of reconciliation, till you see she
stands in need of consolation. This
chastisement may be either public
or private, as it may benefit the
child&mdash;either in covering her with
shame, or shewing her how she has
been spared such a mortification&mdash;a
<i>public</i> exposition should, however,
never be resorted to but in the last
extremity. It may be as well sometimes
to make use of a rational
person to perform the office of
mediator&mdash;who might console the
child, and mention such things
which would be improper for yourself
to do&mdash;who might cure her of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>false shame, and induce her to come
to you for reconciliation&mdash;and to
whom the child, in the emotions
of her heart, would open herself
more freely than she would dare to
do to yourself. Above all, let it be
manifest that you never exact from a
child more than necessary submission:
endeavour to effect it so that
she may pass her own condemnation,
and that you have little else
to do but assuage the anguish she
has herself inflicted. General rules
ought to be adopted as particular
occasions may justify: men, and
especially children, do not always
resemble themselves&mdash;that which is
good to-day, may be bad to-morrow;
a conduct stubbornly uniform can
never be advantageous.</p>

<p>The fewer formal lessons that are
inculcated, the better. A thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>modes of instruction may be
adopted in the freedom of conversation,
more useful than lessons
themselves. I have known many
children who have learnt to read
during their play; we need only
relate to them some diverting story
from a book opened in their presence,
and make them insensibly become
acquainted with their letters;
after this, they will themselves be
anxious to arrive at the source
which has afforded them such
amusement.</p>

<p>There are two circumstances
which spoil every thing; namely,
teaching them at first to read in a
foreign tongue<a name="fnr_3" id="fnr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><sup><span class="small">3</span></sup></a>&mdash;which takes away
all pleasure in reading; and making
them read with a forced and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>ridiculous emphasis. Give them a book
handsomely bound, with neat cuts,
and printed with a fine type;
every thing which delights the
fancy, facilitates study: we should
even let them have a book full of
short and marvellous stories. After
this, do not be uneasy about the
child's learning to read&mdash;do not
fatigue her by requiring too great a
precision; let her pronounce naturally
as she speaks: other tones are
always bad, and partake of the
declamation of the stage. When the
tongue has acquired sufficient volubility,
the chest strength, and the
habit of reading been confirmed,
she will then read without pain,
and with more grace and distinctness.</p>

<p>The manner of teaching to
write should be pretty nearly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>same. When children can read a
little, one may amuse them in
making them sort the letters; and
if there are several pupils, emulation
may be kindled. Children are
naturally inclined to make figures
on paper; and if this propensity be
encouraged, without teasing them
too much, they will form letters
during their play, and accustom
themselves by degrees to write.
One may also encourage them by
the promise of a reward adapted to
their taste, and which has no unpleasant
consequences.</p>

<p>"Write me a note," you may say,
"inform your brother or cousin
of such and such things:" all this
(varied as you like) pleases a child,
provided that no sad idea of a
formal lesson intrude. "A free
curiosity," says St. Austin, from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>own experience, "excites the mental
faculties of a child, much more
than the formality of rules, or a
constraint imposed by fear."</p>

<p>Observe this grand defect in ordinary
educations&mdash;all pleasure is
placed on one side, and pain on
the other: the latter is attached to
study, the former to play. What
then can be expected from a child,
but that, in supporting one of these
maxims, she will eagerly fly to her
amusements?</p>

<p>Let us try to invert this order:
let us make study agreeable, concealing
it under the form of liberty
and pleasure: the dull routine of
continued application may be
sometimes broken in upon by little
sallies of amusement. Children
require these relaxations to preserve
the elasticity of their mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Let their imaginations roam a
little. Permit occasionally some
game or diversion, so that ample
bounds be given to their spirits;
then bring them gently back again
to the principal object you have in
view. Too rigid or too long continued
an application to study, is
productive of much injury: those
who affect this regularity, act more
from the convenience of stated
hours of discipline, than from
wishing to seize every favourable
moment of instruction. At the same
time, do not suffer any amusement
which may agitate the passions of
children: on the contrary, every
thing which can unbend their
faculties, produce an agreeable
variety, satisfy a curiosity for useful
things, and exercise their body in
healthful recreations, should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>recommended and practiced in their
diversions. The amusements which
they like best, are those that keep
the body in motion; they are
happy if they can but skip from place
to place: a shuttle-cock or a ball
is sufficient. We should not, however,
be uneasy about their diversions;
they invent quite enough
themselves&mdash;it is sufficient if we
leave them to their own inventions,
watch them with a cheerful
countenance, and moderate them
when they become too violent. It
would be prudent just to make them
sensible, as much and as often as we
can, of the pleasure which results
from the cultivation of the <i>mind</i>;
such as conversation, news, histories,
and many industrious games which
include instruction. All this will
have its proper effect in due time:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>but we should not force the feelings
of children on this subject; we
should only make overtures to
them. The period will arrive when
their bodies will be inclined to
move less, and their minds, more.</p>

<p>The care which is taken to season
study with amusement, will operate
favourably in abating the ardour of
youth for dangerous diversions. It
is subjection and <i>ennui</i> that beget
an impatience for amusement. If
a daughter felt less restraint in the
presence of a mother, she would
not be so anxious to steal away in
search of indifferent society.</p>

<p>In choosing diversions, care must
be taken to avoid all suspicious
companions. Boys must not mingle
with girls; even girls of an unruly
and froward disposition must be
rejected. Games which excite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>passion, and thoughtlessness, or
which produce an improper attitude
of the body&mdash;frequent visiting
abroad, and conversations which
give rise to such visits&mdash;should be
uniformly avoided. When a child
is not spoilt by any rude diversion,
or is not stimulated by any ardent
passion, it will easily find pleasure
and content: health and innocence
are the sure sources of both: but
those who have been accustomed
to violent amusements, lose all relish
for moderate pleasure, and
weary themselves in a restless search
after happiness.</p>

<p>There may be a satiated taste for
amusements, as well as for food:
one may be so accustomed to high-seasoned
dishes, that a simple and
common diet will become flat and
insipid. Let us, therefore, be on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>our guard against those violent
exercises, which in the end produce
<i>ennui</i> and disgust: above all,
they are to be particularly dreaded
in regard to <i>children</i>; who are less
capable in suppressing their feelings,
and who wish to be in perpetual
motion. Let us manage them
so as to excite a taste for simple
things: that great preparations of
food be not necessary for their
nourishment, nor violent diversions
for their amusement. A moderate
fare always creates a sufficient appetite,
without being obliged to
pamper it with <i>made dishes</i>, which
produce intemperance. "Temperance,"
says an ancient writer, "is
the best contriver of luxury: with
this temperance, which begets health
of body and mind, one always enjoys
a soft and tranquil emotion&mdash;there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>is no need of trick or public
shew, or expense, to make one
happy: some little diversion, or
reading, or labor&mdash;a walk, or innocent
conversation, which relaxes
after toil&mdash;all or any of these produce
a purer delight than is felt
from the most exquisite music."</p>

<p>It is true, simple pleasures are less
lively and interesting than violent
ones, which elevate the soul, and
affect all the sources of passion.
But simple pleasures have a better
tendency; they produce an equal
and lasting joy, without any bitter
consequence. They are always of
real service, whereas violent ones
may be compared to adulterated
wine, which pleases at first, but
which eventually injures the health.
The very temperament of the soul,
as well as the taste, is affected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>seeking after such violent and seductive
pleasures. All that you can
do for children who are under your
regulation is, to accustom them to
such a simple life as has been just
described; to fortify them in such
habits as long as you can, to make
them foresee the evil consequences
attached to other amusements, and
not to abandon them to <i>themselves</i>;
as is too commonly the case, at an
age when their passions begin to be
shewn, and when, consequently,
they stand in need of greater
restraint.</p>

<p>It must be allowed, that of all
the vexations incidental to education,
none can be compared with
that which is experienced in the
rearing of a <i>stupid</i> child. Those
who have strong lively natural
capacities are, indeed, liable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>terrible irregularities&mdash;passion and
presumption master them entirely;
but, on the other hand, they have
great resources, and may be easily
checked, however turbulent. Education
is, in them, a concealed but
vegetating germe, which sometimes
bears fruit when experience comes
to the aid of reason, and when the
passions begin to cool. At least we
know how to make them attentive,
and awaken their curiosity: they
have something in them which
makes them take an interest in their
lessons, and stimulates their sense of
honour&mdash;whereas one has no sort
of pleasure or gratification in the
instruction of <i>stupid</i> children. All
their thoughts are distracted: they
are never where they ought to be:
the most poignant correction has
no effect on them: they hear every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>thing, and feel nothing. This indolence
and stupidity makes a child
negligent and disgusted with every
thing she does. She is in such a case,
that the <i>best mode</i> of education runs
a risk of miscarrying, if we do not
guard against the evil, from earliest
infancy. Many people who have
little depth of penetration, conclude,
from this bad success, that
nature does <i>every thing</i> in the formation
of men of merit, and education
<i>nothing</i>&mdash;instead of remarking
that there are dispositions, like
barren soils, on which cultivation
produces little. It is yet more lamentable
when these knotty systems
of education have been thwarted or
neglected, or badly regulated at the
beginning.</p>

<p>We must not forget that there are
many dispositions among children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>in which we are likely to be deceived.
They appear at first interesting,
because there is attached
to early youth a certain fascinating
lustre which covers every thing:
we, at first, perceive nothing but
what is tender and amiable, and this
prevents a closer examination of the
features of the mind. Every sally
of their wit surprises us, because we
do not expect it at such an age:
every error in judgment is permitted,
and it has, moreover, the charm
of ingenuity: they assume a certain
vivacity of deportment, which never
fails to pass for sprightliness and
intellect. Hence it is, that childhood
often promises much, but
realises little. Such a one was celebrated
for her wit at five years of
age, but now, in proportion to her
growth, she has fallen into obscurity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>and contempt! Of all the qualities
which children possess, there is but
one on which you can calculate
with certainty, and that is, <i>good sense</i>:
this "grows with their growth,"
provided it be well cultivated. The
graces of infancy fade away&mdash;its
vivacity diminishes&mdash;and that tenderness
of heart even becomes
blunted, in proportion as the passions
and an intercourse with designing
men harden young people
on their entrance into the world.
Strive, therefore, to discover midst
the graces of childhood, whether the
disposition you have to manage be
deficient in curiosity, and insensible
of honest emulation. If this should
be the case, it is almost impossible
for every one concerned in her
tuition, not to be disgusted with so
rugged and ungrateful an occupation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Every qualification of a child
should be roused and brought into
action, in order to extricate it from
so fatal a lethargy. If, however,
you foresee any such consequences
about to follow, do not at first be
anxious to urge any serious application:
take care not to overcharge
her memory, for it is that which
stuns and stupifies the brain: do not
harass her with unpleasant regulations:
make her as cheerful as you
can, because she labours under the
opposite extreme of presumption:
do not be afraid of shewing her,
with discretion, the extent of her
powers: be satisfied with little at a
time: make her remark the smallest
success: shew her how absurd it is
to be afraid of not succeeding in
that which she really does well:
set her emulation to work. Jealousy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>is more violent among children
than we are aware of: we often see
some who are absolutely fretting
and wearing away, because others
are more beloved and caressed than
themselves. Mothers are often
cruel enough to fan this jealous
flame, which, however, is of service
in extreme cases of indolence and
stupidity&mdash;but then you should set
before the child the examples of
those who are but <i>very little</i> superior&mdash;for
disproportionate examples
of those who are greatly superior,
serve only to discourage and dismay.</p>

<p>Let her, occasionally, gain some
little victories over those of whom
she is jealous: make her, if you
can, laugh heartily with yourself at
her timidity: and set before her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>those, equally timid with herself,
who have conquered their disposition
to fear: make her sensible,
by indirect instructions, and the
example of others, that timidity and
idleness destroy all the mental
energies; but be careful not to
give these instructions in an austere
and impetuous manner: nothing
wounds the inmost feelings of a
mild and timid child so much as
boisterous treatment: on the contrary,
let the application which
becomes indispensible, be seasoned
and relieved by such little circumstances
of amusement and recreation
as are suited to her disposition.
Perhaps it will be sometimes necessary
to check her by reproaches;
but this should not be done by
yourself: employ some inferior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>person, or another child, without
appearing yourself to be acquainted
with it.</p>

<p>St. Austin relates, that his mother
was once reproached by a servant
for drinking pure wine; an ill habit
which she had contracted from her
infancy, and of which she was cured
by the servant's reproach, though
all the vehemence and severity of
her governess was unable to effect
it. In short one should endeavour
to excite <i>a taste</i> in the minds of
such sort of children, in like manner
as one tries to excite it in the palate
of those who are sick. <i>They</i> are
permitted to have any thing which
may cure their loathing; they are
indulged in many whims at the expence
of certain prescribed rules,
provided it be not carried to a
dangerous excess. It is much more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>arduous to create a taste in those
that are void of one, than to regulate
the taste of those who have not a
correct one.</p>

<p>There is another kind of sensibility
extremely difficult and
important to impress them with,
and that is, <i>friendship</i>. As soon as
a child is susceptible of it, there
can be no doubt but that you should
turn her heart towards those who
may be useful to her. Friendship
will give her every accomplishment
that you desire; you have then a
certain tie on her, if you know how
to regulate it: excess, or a bad
choice, are the only things you
have to dread. There are, however,
some children who are born cunning,
reserved, and callous, and who
bring every thing home, as it were,
to their own bosoms: they deceive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>their parents, whom fondness has
made credulous: they <i>appear</i> to
love them: they regulate their inclinations
to conform to them:
they <i>seem</i> more docile than other
children of the same age, who indulge,
without restraint, in all their
humours and follies: their suppleness,
or rather hypocrisy, which
conceals a savage temper, assumes
a softness of character; and their
real disposition does not discover
itself till it is too late to reform it.</p>

<p>If there really be any child on
whom education is incapable of
producing a good effect, it is one
of the foregoing description; and
it must be allowed that the
number is greater than we imagine.
Parents bring themselves with difficulty
to believe that their children
have a bad heart: when they shut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>their <i>own eyes</i> upon them, no other
person will have the courage to
convince them of it; and thus the
evil is hourly augmenting. The
principal remedy is, to place
children, from their earliest infancy,
in such a situation where
their tempers may be discovered
without disguise. Always know
the very bottom of their heart, before
you correct them. They are
naturally simple and open; but as
soon as you plague them, or give
them an example of disguise, they
will no longer return to their original
simplicity. It is true, that a
good and tender-hearted disposition
comes from God alone; <i>we</i>
can only endeavour to excite it by
generous examples, by maxims of
honour and disinterestedness, and
by a contempt of those people who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>set too high a value on themselves.
We must endeavour to make children
betimes sensible of the most
natural modes of conduct, and of
the pleasure arising from a cordial,
and reciprocal friendship. Nothing
so much conduces to this end, as an
intercourse with people who have
nothing about them harsh, severe,
low, or selfish: children might
better associate with those who
have other faults, than with those
who possess the foregoing ones.
We should praise them for every
thing they do on the score of friendship,
provided it be not misplaced
or too violent. Parents must likewise
appear to them to be animated
with the sincerest friendship towards
them; for children oftentimes learn
of their parents to have no affection
for any one object. In short I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>would check, before friends, all superfluous
compliments, all artificial
demonstrations of esteem, and all
feigned caresses: for by these things
you teach them a great deal of
deceit towards those whom they
ought to regard.</p>

<p>There is a very common fault
among girls, the opposite to what
we have been mentioning; namely,
the affecting to be uncommonly
struck and delighted with the most
insignificant things. They cannot
see two people who are both equally
bad, without taking the part, in
their hearts, of one against the
other. They are full either of
affection or aversion, without the
least cause: they perceive no defect
in what they esteem, and no one
good quality in what they despise.
You must not, at first, make a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>formidable opposition to all this&mdash;for
contradiction will only fortify
them in their vagaries: but observe,
by degrees, to a young girl, that you
know better than herself what good
there is in that which she likes, and
what evil in that which she detests.
Take care also, occasionally, to
make her sensible of certain defects
which are sometimes found in the
object of her regard, and of certain
good qualities which are discernible
in that of her hatred: do not be
too urgent: press her not too
much, and you will find that she
will come to herself, and coincide
with your sentiments. After which,
make her reflect on her past caprices,
and the most unreasonable
circumstances attending them: tell
her, gently, that she will by and
bye see those of which she is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>yet cured, when they cease to act.
Recount to her similar errors of
<i>your own</i> when you was of her age.
Above all, shew her as clearly, and
as sensibly as you can, that good
and evil are inherent in every
object of our love and aversion:
this will repress her ardour in the
indulgence of either the one or the
other.</p>

<p>Never promise children, by way
of reward, fine clothes or dainties;
this has two direct evils attending
it: the first will teach them to set
a value on what they ought to
despise; the second deprives you
of an opportunity of establishing
<i>other</i> rewards which would facilitate
your labour. Be on your
guard against threatening them to
make them study, or subjecting
them to any formal rule. Make as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>few rules as possible: and when
there is an absolute necessity for
one, make it pass lightly under the
child's notice, without giving it
such a name; and always give
some reason why a thing is done
at one time and in one place, rather
than in another. You run a risk of
disheartening children if they are
not praised when they have done
well. Praise may sometimes be
apprehended on account of its
exciting vanity; but it should
nevertheless be employed to animate,
not to intoxicate, children.</p>

<p>We find that St. Paul has often
made use of it, in encouraging the
weak, and in softening his reproaches.
The Fathers have also
made the same use of it. It is true,
that to make it serviceable, it must
be so tempered that it take away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>all exaggeration, and flattery, and
that the good resulting from it be
attributed to God alone, as the
source. Children may be recompensed
by innocent and industrious
games; by walks and recreations,
in which conversation may take a
useful turn: by little presents which
may be a kind of prize&mdash;as pictures,
prints, medals, maps of geography,
or gilt books.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Of the Use of History for Children.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>Children are passionately fond
of marvellous tales: one sees them
every day transported with joy, or
drowned in tears, at the recital of
certain adventures. Do not fail to
profit by this propensity. When
you find them disposed to listen
to you, relate to them some short
and pretty fable: but choose some
ingenious and harmless one respecting
animals: repeat them just as
they are composed, and shew them
the moral resulting therefrom. As
to <i>pagan fables</i>, a girl will be happy
in her total ignorance of them, as
they are extremely indelicate and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>replete with impious absurdities. If,
however, you are not able to keep
a child ignorant of them, impress
her with a sense of their horror.
When you have repeated one fable,
wait till you are asked to begin
another&mdash;thus leaving the child
hungry, as it were, for more mental
food. When curiosity is at last
excited, recount certain choice histories,
but in as few words as possible:
connect them together, and
postpone the sequel from one day
to another, so that you keep the
children in suspense, and impatient
to know the termination. Be animated
and familiar in your manner
of repeating&mdash;make the personages
speak&mdash;and children, who have a
lively imagination, will fancy they
hear and see them. For instance,
relate the history of Joseph&mdash;make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>his brothers speak like brutal characters,
but Jacob like a tender and
afflicted father&mdash;then let Joseph
himself speak&mdash;taking pleasure, as
being at the head of an Egyptian
establishment, in concealing himself
from his brothers&mdash;in making
them afraid of him; and, at last, in
discovering himself to them. This
natural representation, joined to
the extraordinary circumstances of
the history, will delight a child;
provided she be not teased with
too many similar recitals. You may
let her express a desire for such
stories, and promise them as a
recompense for a prudent conduct,
provided they assume not the form
of study&mdash;provided the child is not
<i>obliged</i> to repeat them; for these
repetitions, if not voluntarily undertaken,
will discompose and fret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>her, and take away all pleasure
arising from such sort of narrations.</p>

<p>It must be observed that if a
child has any facility in speaking,
she will, of her own accord, relate
to those whom she likes, such histories
as have pleased her most:
but do not let her make a rule of
it. You may employ some one,
who is on a footing of perfect intimacy
with the child, to appear
anxious to learn of her a particular
story: the child will be delighted
in repeating it. Do not appear
yourself to listen very earnestly to
it&mdash;let her go on as she likes, without
checking her in her faults. The
consequence will be, that when she
is more accustomed to repeat, you
may gently make her sensible of a
better manner of narrating, by rendering
it short, simple, and easy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>and by a choice of circumstances
better calculated to represent forcibly
the nature of each thing. If
you have many children, accustom
them by degrees to <i>represent</i> the
historical characters whom they
read of&mdash;one may be Abraham, the
other, Isaac. These representations
will charm them more than any
other games&mdash;will accustom them
to think, and to utter serious things
with pleasure&mdash;and will indelibly
fix such histories on their memory.</p>

<p>We should strive to give them a
taste for scriptural history rather
than for any other; not in <i>telling</i> them
that it is finer, which they will probably
not believe&mdash;but in causing
them to <i>feel</i> it to be so. Make them
observe how important, wonderful,
and curious those histories are:
how full of natural representation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>and a spirit of noble simplicity.
Those of the creation, the fall of
Adam, the deluge, the call of Abraham,
the sacrifice of Isaac, the adventures
of Joseph (which have
been briefly discussed), and the birth
and flight of Moses, are not only
calculated to awaken the curiosity
of children, but in discovering to
them the origin of religion, fix the
foundations of it in their bosoms.
We must be strangely ignorant of
the essential parts of religion not to
observe that they are chiefly historical:
it is by a tissue, as it were,
of marvellous facts that we discover
its establishment, its perpetuity, and
all that can induce us to believe
and to practice it. It is not to be
supposed that by all this we wish
children to be plunged into profound
knowledge&mdash;on the contrary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>these histories are short, various,
and calculated to please the meanest
capacity. The Almighty, who best
knows the faculties of that being
whom he has created, has clothed
religion in <i>popular facts</i>, which, far
from overpowering the simple, assists
them in conceiving and retaining
its mysteries. For example, tell
a child, that in God there are three
equal persons, but of one nature:
by the habit of hearing and repeating
these terms, she may retain
them in her memory; but I doubt
whether she will understand the
sense of them. Relate to her that
as Jesus Christ went up out of the
waters of Jordan, the Almighty
caused these words to be heard&mdash;"This
is my beloved son in whom
I am well pleased&mdash;hear him:" add,
that the Holy Ghost descended on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>our Saviour, in the form of a dove&mdash;and
thus, you make her sensible of
the <span class="smallcaps">Trinity</span>, in a history which
she will never forget. Here are
<i>three persons</i> which she will distinguish
by the difference of their
actions; you have nothing more,
therefore, but to inform her that all
these together make but one God.
This example is sufficient to shew
the use of history. Although it
may <i>seem</i> to make instruction more
tedious, it really abridges it; and
renders the dryness of catechism,
where mysteries are detached from
facts, unnecessary. We may observe
that history was an ancient
mode of instruction. The admirable
method which St. Austin has
pointed out for the instruction of the
ignorant, was not suggested by that
father alone&mdash;it was the universal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>method and practice of the church:
it consisted in shewing, by a succession
of historical facts, religion to
be as ancient as the world&mdash;Jesus
Christ conspicuous in the Old Testament,
and pervading every part
of the New: which, in truth, is the
foundation of christian instruction.</p>

<p>All this demands a little more
time and care than are devoted to
the usual habits of instruction with
which many people content themselves:
but in adopting such a
mode, religion will be truly taught;
whereas, when children are not so
instructed, they have only confused
ideas of Jesus Christ, the Gospel,
the church, of the necessity of
absolute submission to its decrees,
and of the foundation of those
virtues with which the christian
character should inspire us. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span><i>historical</i> catechism, which is simple,
short, and more perspicuous than
the ordinary catechism, includes
every thing necessary to be known
thereupon&mdash;so that it need not be
said that much study is necessary.<a name="fnr_4" id="fnr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><sup><span class="small">4</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Let us now add to the facts before
mentioned from scripture, the passage
of the Red Sea, and the sojourning
of the people in the
desert&mdash;where they ate bread which
fell from heaven, and drank water
which Moses caused to flow from
the rock, by striking it with his
rod. Represent the miraculous
conquest of the promised land,
where the waters of Jordan went
backwards toward their source, and
the walls of a city fell down of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>themselves in the sight of the
besiegers. Describe, in as natural
colours as possible, the combats of
Saul and David: and how the latter,
a youth, without arms and habited
like a shepherd, became the conqueror
of the fierce and gigantic
Goliah. Do not forget the glory
and wisdom of Solomon: how he
decided between the two women
who disputed about a child&mdash;but do
not forget to impress on the mind,
how he fell from this height of wisdom;
dishonouring himself by an
effeminacy, which is almost the
inevitable consequence of overgrown
prosperity.</p>

<p>Next make the prophets, as delegated
from heaven, converse with
kings: shew how they read the
future as if in a book: how they
suffered continual persecution for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>having spoken the truth. Speak,
in succession, of the first destruction
of Jerusalem&mdash;represent the
temple burning, and the holy city
in ruins on account of the sins of
the people. Relate the Babylonian
captivity, and how the Jews wept
"when they thought on Sion."
Before their return, represent the
interesting adventures of Tobit,
Judith, Esther, and Daniel. It
may not be amiss to let children
give their opinion on the different
characters of these holy persons, to
know which of them they admire
the most. One will prefer Esther,
the other Judith&mdash;and this may
excite a little controversy between
them, which will impress those
histories more strongly on their
minds, and form their judgments
thereupon. Afterwards, bring back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>the Jews from captivity to Jerusalem,
and make them repair their
desolated city; then paint, in smiling
colours, the peace and happiness
which succeeded. Shortly
you will have to draw a picture of
the cruel Antiochus, who died in
false repentance: describe, under
this persecutor, the victories of the
Maccabees, and the martyrdom of
the seven brothers of that name.</p>

<p>Descend regularly to the miraculous
birth of St. John: and relate,
more in detail, that of our Saviour
Jesus Christ: after which you must
select in the four Gospels all the
remarkable occurrences of his life&mdash;his
preaching in the temple at
twelve years of age&mdash;his baptism&mdash;his
retreat and temptation in the
desert&mdash;the calling of the apostles&mdash;the
miracle of the loaves&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>conversion of the sinful woman, who
anointed the feet of our Saviour
with a precious perfume&mdash;washed
them with her tears, and dried
them with her hair. Represent
the Samaritan woman instructed;
Lazarus restored to life; and Christ's
triumphant entry into Jerusalem.
Next describe his passion, and his
resurrection from the tomb. Afterwards
make them remark the familiarity
with which he continued
forty days with his disciples, until
they saw him ascend into heaven.
Next will follow the descent of
the Holy Ghost; the stoning of
Stephen; the conversion of St. Paul;
and the calling of the centurion Cornelius:
the voyages of the apostles,
and particularly of St. Paul, are
<i>yet</i> extremely interesting. Select
the most wonderful histories of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>the martyrs, and give a general
outline of the celestial life of the
first christians: mingle with it the
courage of young virgins, the astonishing
austerity of those who led
a solitary life, the conversion of
emperors and of the empire, the
blindness of the Jews, and the punishment
which yet awaits them.</p>

<p>All these histories (managed with
discretion) of the whole series of religion,
from the creation to the present
time, would make an agreeable
impression on the lively and tender
minds of children; and would fill
them with such noble ideas of it as
would never be forgotten. They
would even see, in this narration,
the hand of God always lifted up
to protect the good, and to punish
the wicked. They would accustom
themselves to behold the Almighty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>working all in all, secretly directing
the movement of creatures however
remote from himself. But care
must be taken to select such passages
in these histories as afford the most
beautiful and magnificent images;
for every faculty must be employed
to shew religion to children adorned
with every thing amiable, pleasing,
and august; and not to represent
it, as is too commonly the case, as
something sad and disagreeable.</p>

<p>Besides the inestimable advantage
of teaching religion in this manner
to children&mdash;such a series of pleasant
histories, which they learn betimes
to remember, awakens their curiosity
for serious things; makes them
sensible of the pleasures of the
mind, and excites an interest in the
hearing of <i>other</i> histories which
have some connection with those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>they already know. But again I
repeat, never make a <i>rigid law</i> that
they should hear and retain these
things&mdash;much less let them be inculcated
as <i>regular lessons</i>: for the
pleasure which they take in such
recitals should be <i>voluntary</i>, and
without this, nothing important can
be effected. Do not urge them
much&mdash;you will attain the desired
end, even with ordinary understandings:<a name="fnr_5" id="fnr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><sup><span class="small">5</span></sup></a>
you have nothing to
do but exercise their capacities
<i>moderately</i>, and let their curiosity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>be excited, by degrees. But you
will say, how are those histories to
be repeated in a lively, short, natural,
and agreeable manner? Where
are the teachers who can accomplish
such a thing? To this I
answer, that I propose it only that
you should <i>endeavour</i> to choose
persons of an excellent understanding
to govern your children, and
that they be gifted, as much as
possible, with this method of teaching:
every governess will undertake
it in proportion to her talents. But
if there be only a candour and
openness of intellect, the thing
will go on with good effect when
children are formed to this manner,
which is natural and simple.</p>

<p>To discourse or description, may
be added the sight of <i>pictures</i>,
which represent sacred subjects.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Prints will be sufficient, which may
be preserved for ordinary use&mdash;but
when an opportunity offers of shewing
a child <i>good paintings</i>, it must
not be neglected: for the force of
colouring, and the grandeur of
composition, will strike the imagination
with greater effect.</p>

<p class="med"><a name="fn_4" id="fn_4"></a><a href="#fnr_4">4.</a> I have omitted the remark which here follows&mdash;because
it alludes to the catechism of the <i>Council of
Trent</i>, with which we have nothing to do in this
country.</p>

<p class="med"><a name="fn_5" id="fn_5"></a><a href="#fnr_5">5.</a> I may be permitted to add, that if children do not
discover any propensity to these studies, we should
neither neglect nor despise them; provided their dispositions
and conduct be good and regular in other matters.
Besides, nothing conclusive can, at first, be drawn from
their inattention to these subjects; for a child at <i>twelve</i>
years of age may evince as great a <i>regard</i> for them, as she
did <i>indifference</i>, at <i>ten</i>. There is little consistency in
the human intellect at such a volatile period: the girl of
gaity and dissipation at <i>eighteen</i>, may become the devotee
at <i>five and twenty</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_VII" id="ch_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Of Inculcating Principles of Religion in<br />
the Minds of Children.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>It has been before observed that
the first years of childhood are not
calculated for reasoning: not that
children are divested of those ideas
and general principles of reason
which hereafter become manifest,
but that they are ignorant of many
facts, which hinders the application
of their reason; and, moreover,
leaves that agitation of the brain,
which prevents them from connecting
their ideas.</p>

<p>We should, however, without
pressing them, gently direct the use
of their reason towards a knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>of God. Persuade them of Christian
truths, without giving them
subjects of doubt. They observe
some one to be dead: they know
that burial afterwards follows: say
to them&mdash;"Is this dead person in
the tomb?" "<i>Yes.</i>" "He is not then
in paradise?" "<i>Pardon me, he is.</i>"
"How can he be in the grave and
in paradise at the same time?" "<i>It
is his soul which is in paradise&mdash;his
body only in the grave.</i>" His soul
and body then are not the same
thing?" "<i>No.</i>" "The soul, therefore,
is not dead?" "<i>No&mdash;It will live for ever
in heaven.</i>" Add: "And you, do
you wish to be saved?" "<i>Yes.</i>"
"But what is being saved?" "<i>It is the
soul's going into paradise.</i>" "And
what is death?" "<i>It is the mouldering
of the body into dust, when the soul
has left it.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>I do not pretend to say that
children may <i>at first</i> be taught to
answer in this manner: though I
may add that many have given me
such answers when they were four
years of age. Let us, however, suppose
a child to be extremely reserved
and uninstructed:&mdash;the worst that
can happen is, the waiting only a
few more years with patience.</p>

<p>Shew children a house, and make
them comprehend that this house
did not build itself. The stones or
bricks, say you, were not elevated
without some one's carrying them
so high. It may be as well, too, to
shew them the masons at work:
then make them contemplate heaven
and earth, and the principal things
which God has made for the use of
man: say to them "how much
more beautiful and better made is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>the world than a house! Was it
made of itself? No&mdash;assuredly it
was made by the hands of the
Almighty."</p>

<p>First follow the method of scripture.
Strike their imaginations in
as lively a manner as possible&mdash;propose
to them nothing which
may not be clothed with sensible
images. Represent God as seated
on a throne&mdash;with eyes more brilliant
than the rays of the sun, and
more piercing than the lightning&mdash;represent
him with ears that hear
every thing; with hands that support
the universe; with arms always
stretched out to punish the wicked;
and with a tender and paternal
heart to make those happy who
love him. The time will come
when this information may be rendered
more exact. Observe every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>opening of the mind which a child
presents to you: try her by different
methods, so that you may discover
how these great truths will best
occupy her attention. Above all,
talk of nothing new, without familiarising
her to it by some obvious
comparison.</p>

<p>For example&mdash;ask her if she
would rather die than renounce
Jesus Christ&mdash;she will answer&mdash;<i>Yes</i>.
Then say&mdash;"how, would you suffer
your head to be cut off in order to
enter paradise?" <i>Yes.</i> The child
will now think she has sufficient
courage to do it. But you, who
are willing to make her sensible
that nothing can be effected without
<i>grace</i>, will gain nothing, if you
merely say that grace alone is sufficient
to produce faithfulness&mdash;the
child does not understand those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>words; and if you accustom her to
repeat them without understanding
them, you gain nothing by it.
What then is to be done? Relate
to her the history of St. Peter: represent
him saying, in a presumptuous
tone of voice&mdash;"I will follow
thee even unto death, though all
the rest should desert thee, yet will
I never abandon thee." Then describe
his fall: he denies his master,
Christ, three times&mdash;even a servant
makes him tremble. Declare why
God permitted this weakness&mdash;then
make use of the comparison of a
child or sick person who cannot
walk alone&mdash;and make her comprehend,
that as an infant must be
supported in the arms of its nurse,
so we stand in need of the Almighty's
assistance. Thus you will make
her sensible of the mystery of grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>But the most difficult truth for a
child to comprehend is, that we
have a soul more precious than our
body. Children are at first accustomed
to talk about the soul; and
the custom is advantageous&mdash;for this
language, which they do not understand,
is perpetually exciting them
to have a (confused) notion of the
distinction of body and soul, until
they are able really to conceive it.
In proportion as early prejudices
are pernicious when they lead to
error, so are they useful when they
conduct the imagination to truth,
until reason is gradually directed
towards it by the force of principles.
But, at length, we must
fix <i>a true persuasion</i>&mdash;and how are
we to set about it? Is it in plunging
a young girl in philosophical
subtleties? Nothing is worse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>calculated for it. We must confine
ourselves to render clear and distinct
to her mind, what she hears
and speaks every day.</p>

<p>As to her <i>person</i>, she is perhaps
too well instructed in the knowledge
of <i>that</i>: every thing induces her to
flatter, adorn, and idolise it. An
essential point is gained if you can
inspire her with contempt for it,
by observing something of greater
value about her.</p>

<p>Say then to a child who is capable
of a little reasoning&mdash;Is it your
soul that eats? If she answers absurdly,
do not be harsh with her&mdash;but
tell her mildly that the soul
does not eat&mdash;It is the body that
eats&mdash;the body, which resembles
the brutes. Have brutes intellect&mdash;are
they learned? <i>No</i>, the child will
answer. But they eat, you will add,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>although they have no intellect:
you see, therefore, that it is not the
soul which eats&mdash;it is the body
which takes food to nourish it&mdash;it
is <i>that</i> which walks, and which
sleeps. And what does the soul do?
It reasons&mdash;it knows every one&mdash;it
loves certain things, and dislikes
others. Go on, in a playful manner,
"Do you know this table?" <i>Yes.</i>
"You know it then?" <i>To be sure.</i>
"You see clearly that it is not made
like that chair, which is formed of
wood, and not like the chimney
piece, of stone?" <i>Yes</i>, the child will
reply. Proceed no farther without
being convinced, by her tone of
voice, and by the child's eyes, that
these simple truths have struck her.
Then say&mdash;But does this table know
you? You will see that the child
will begin laughing, and ridiculing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>as it were, such a question.&mdash;No
matter: go on&mdash;Which loves you
the best, that table or that chair?
She will still keep laughing&mdash;but
pursue the discourse&mdash;Is the window
very wise? Then try to go
further&mdash;Does this doll answer you
when you speak to it? <i>No.</i> Why&mdash;has
it no intellect? <i>No, none.</i> It is
not then like you; for you know
it, and it does not know you. But
after death, when you will be under
the ground, shall not you be like
this doll? <i>Yes.</i> You will no longer
feel any thing? <i>No.</i> You will no
longer know any body? <i>No.</i> And
your soul will be in heaven? <i>Yes.</i>
Will it not then see God? <i>True, it
will.</i> And where is the soul of the
doll at present? You will perceive
that the child will answer with a
laugh&mdash;or at least that it will make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>you understand the doll has no
soul.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation, and by
means of these simple illustrations,
enforced at different times, you may
accustom the child, by degrees, to
attribute both to the body and the
soul, that which is peculiar to each&mdash;provided
you do not indiscreetly
propose to her consideration, certain
actions which are common to
the one and the other. All subtilty
must be avoided, as it perplexes
truth; and we must content ourselves
to point out, with care and
correctness, those circumstances that
mark distinctly the difference between
the body and soul. Sometimes
one meets with such stupid
characters, whom even the help of
a good education will not assist in
the comprehension of these truths:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>however, they may be sometimes
clearly <i>conceived</i>, without being perspicuously
expressed. God sees
better than we do into the spirit of
man, what is there placed for the
knowledge of his mysteries.</p>

<p>With respect to those children
in whom we discover a mind capable
of further researches, one
may, without throwing them into
a study which savours too much
of philosophy, make them conceive,
according to their inclination,
what is meant when it is
said that God is a spirit, and that
the soul is also a spirit. I think
that the best and most simple
method of making them conceive
this spirituality of God
and of the soul, is, to make them
remark the difference between a
dead and living man: in the one,
there is nothing but a body; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>the other, the soul is united with
the body. Afterwards you may
shew them that that which is capable
of reasoning, is more perfect
than that which has mere form
and motion. Then illustrate, by
various examples, that no body perishes&mdash;that
it is only separated:
thus, pieces of burnt wood fall
into charcoal, or evaporate in
smoke. If then, you will add, that
which is of itself only charcoal (incapable
of knowing and thinking)
perishes not&mdash;how much more shall
the soul, which is capable of both
knowledge and thought, endure for
ever! The body may die&mdash;that is
to say, may quit the soul and shrink
into dust&mdash;but the soul will live;
for it will always have the faculty
of thinking.</p>

<p>Those who instruct children,
should develop, as much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>possible, these truths, which are the
foundation of all religion. But if
success should not crown their
exertions, especially with dull obstinate
children, let them hope
that God will enlighten internally.
There is, however, a sensible and
practical way of confirming this
knowledge of the distinction between
body and soul&mdash;and that is,
accustom children to despise the
one, and regard the other, throughout
their manners and intercourse
with the world. Praise that instruction
which nourishes the soul and
causes it to expand: esteem those
great truths which animate it to become
wise and virtuous. Despise
luxury of diet and dress, and every
thing which enervates the body:
make them sensible how much
honour, a good conscience, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>religion, are above these sensual
pleasures. By the force of such
sentiments, without reasoning upon
the body and the soul, the ancient
Romans taught their children to
despise the body, and to sacrifise it
to every thing which could inspire
their minds with the pleasure of
virtue and glory. With them, it
was not simply persons of high
birth, it was the entire mass of the
people who lived temperately, disinterestedly,
despising life, and sensible
only of honour and wisdom,
which excited their applause or
imitation. When I speak of the
ancient Romans, I mean those who
lived before the extension of their
empire had corrupted their simplicity
of manners.</p>

<p>Let it not be said that children
are incapable of receiving these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>prejudices from education. How
often do we discover certain maxims
which have been established
among us, against the impression
of our senses, by the force of custom
alone. For instance, that of
duelling&mdash;founded on a false principle
of honour. It is not by
reasoning, but by taking for granted,
without reasoning, the maxim to be
established on a principle of honour,
that life is exposed, and that every
man who carries a sword lives in
continual danger. Those who have
no quarrel may have one every moment
with certain people, who are
seeking every pretext to signalize
themselves in some duel. However
moderate one may be, such moderation
is hardly preserved, without
violating that false honour, which
will not suffer you to avoid a quarrel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>by an explanation, or to refuse
becoming the second of some one
who has an inclination to fight.
What authorities have not failed in
eradicating so barbarous a custom!
See, therefore, how powerful are
the prejudices of education&mdash;But
how much more powerful will they
be on the side of virtue, supported
by reason, and animated with the
hope of happiness hereafter!</p>

<p>The Romans of whom we have
been speaking, and before them the
Greeks&mdash;in the good times of their
republics, brought up their children
in the contempt of luxury and effeminacy:
they taught them to esteem
glory&mdash;to be ardent, not to heap up
riches, but to conquer those kings
who possessed them&mdash;to believe that
virtue alone was the road to happiness.
This spirit was so strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>established in the foregoing republics,
that they atchieved incredible
things according to those maxims
which were so contrary to the opinions
of all other people. The
examples of so many martyrs, and
of other primitive christians of all
conditions and ages, demonstrates
that the grace of baptism being
united with the help of education,
may make impressions still more
wonderful among the faithful, to
enable them to despise every thing
which is attached to the body. Seek
then for every agreeable circumstance,
every striking comparison,
to convince children that our
bodies are like the brutes&mdash;our
souls like angels. Represent a
knight mounted on a horse and directing
its course: and say, that the
soul is to the body, what the horseman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>is to the horse. Finish your
remarks by observing that the soul
is weak and miserable, when abandoned
to the direction of the body;
which, like a furious horse, would
hurl it down a precipice. Relate,
also, that the beauty of the body,
or external person, is like a flower
which blossoms in the morning,
and withers and is trod under foot
in the evening&mdash;but that the soul
is the express image of the immortal
beauty of God. There is, you may
add, an order of things much more
excellent, which cannot be seen by
the gross eyes of the flesh&mdash;whereas
every thing here below is subject
to change and corruption. In order
to make children sensible that there
are really certain things, which neither
the eyes nor the ears can apprehend,
you may ask them whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>it is not true that such a person is
wise&mdash;and that such an one is witty
or ingenious.&mdash;When they have
answered <i>yes</i>, you may observe&mdash;"But
have you <i>seen</i> the wisdom of
such a person? Of what colour is
it? Have you <i>heard</i> it? Does it
make much noise? Have you <i>touched</i>
it? Is it cold or hot?" The child
will laugh: nevertheless put the
same questions relating to wit or
ingenuity.&mdash;She will appear quite
astonished when she is asked of
what colour is wit&mdash;whether it is
round or square? Then you may
make her remark that she knows
there are many things in reality
which she can neither see, touch,
nor hear; and that these things are
spiritual. But you must enter with
great soberness and caution on these
sort of conversations with girls. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>only propose it here for the sake of
those, whose curiosity and reason,
will bring you, in spite of every
effort to the contrary, to such questions.
You must regulate the discourse
according to the bias of the
child's mind, and the necessity of
the case.</p>

<p>Retain their understandings, as
much as possible, within common
limits: and teach them that there
is a modesty with regard to science,
which belongs to their sex, almost
as delicate as that which is inspired
by the horror of vice.</p>

<p>At the same time you must bring
imagination to the aid of intellect;
to give them pleasing images of the
truths of religion, which the gross
senses of the body are unable to
behold. Paint to them the glory
of heaven, such as St. John has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>represented it!&mdash;tears wiped away
from every eye&mdash;neither death, disease,
nor lamentation&mdash;all agonies
ceasing, all evils at an end&mdash;eternal
joy on the head of the righteous,
like the waters on the head of a
man immersed in the sea! Display
that glorious Jerusalem, of which
God himself will be the Sun, to
create days without an end&mdash;a river
of peace, a torrent of delight, a
fountain of life, shall water it&mdash;there,
every thing shall be gold,
pearls, and precious stones.</p>

<p>I am well aware that all these
images are attached to things sensible;
but after having animated
children with such a beautiful spectacle
so as to rivet their attention,
one may adopt the method just
recommended to bring them to
spiritual things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>Conclude, that we are, in this
world, like travellers in an inn, or
under a tent: that the body is
hastening to decay, and that all our
efforts can retard its corruption but
a few years: but that the soul will
fly away to that celestial country,
where it will live for ever with
God. If children can be brought
to contemplate these grand objects
with pleasure, and to judge of the
common things of life through the
medium of such high hopes, we
shall have accomplished a most
important task.</p>

<p>I would even try to impress them
with strong ideas of the <i>resurrection
of the body</i>. Teach them that nature
is but the common order which
God has established in his works,
and that miracles are only exceptions
to this common order; so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>it is as easy for the Almighty to work
an hundred miracles, as it is for
me to go out of my room a quarter
of an hour before my usual time of
departure. Then call to recollection
the history of the resurrection
of Lazarus, of Jesus Christ, and of
those apparitions which were recognised
for forty days by a great
number of persons. Next, shew that
it cannot be difficult for that Being
who created man, to bring him to
life after dissolution; and do not
forget the comparison of a grain of
corn which is sowed in the earth,
and decays, in order to reproduce
and multiply its species.</p>

<p>Moreover, these moral lessons must
not be taught children by memory,
in like manner as they are taught
the catechism: such a method
would have an immediate tendency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>to convert religion into an affected
language, or at least into troublesome
formalities: only assist their
understanding, and put them in the
way of comprehending the foregoing
truths on their proper foundations:
they will, in consequence,
appear more consistent and agreeable,
and become more vividly impressed
on the mind. Take advantage
of every opportunity to
make them develop with clearness,
what they at present confusedly
behold.</p>

<p>Always bear in mind that nothing
will be more dangerous than to
speak to them with contempt of
this life, when, by the tenor of your
conduct, they discover that you do
not deliver your sentiments with
sincerity and truth. In every period
of life, example has an astonishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>effect upon us&mdash;in infancy, it is
every thing. Children are very
fond of imitation; they have not
yet acquired habits which render
the imitation of another difficult&mdash;besides,
not being of themselves
able to judge profoundly of things,
they judge much more from the
example of those who propose, than
from the reasons which they adduce
in proposing, them. Actions are
much more striking than words:
so that if they observe your actions
do not correspond with your precepts,
they will be disposed to
consider religion, only as a <i>specious
ceremony</i>, and virtue as an <i>impracticable
idea</i>.</p>

<p>Never indulge yourself before
children, in any railleries about
things which have relation to religion,
or on the indiscretion of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>pious persons: you may think all
this innocent&mdash;you are mistaken&mdash;it
will have its certain consequences.
Never speak of God, or of what regards
the worship of him, but with
seriousness and respect, free from all
levity&mdash;observe decorum in every
thing, but particularly on this head.
People who are very nice observers
of it in what regards the world, are
frequently gross and negligent in
respect to religion.</p>

<p>When a child shall have made
such necessary reflections as lead to
a knowledge of herself and of God&mdash;add
to them the historical facts in
which she has already been instructed:
this union will enable her to
have a correct idea of the whole of
religion: and she will remark with
pleasure the connection between
such reflections and the history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>mankind. She will have observed
that man did not make himself, that
his soul is the image of God, that
his body has been formed with so
many admirable resources, by an
industry and power which can only
be divine&mdash;and she will then recollect
the creation. Afterwards she
will think that he is born with inclinations
contrary to reason, that
he has been deceived by pleasure,
carried away by anger, and that his
body hurries on his soul, contrary
to reason, as a furious courser rushes
forward with a horseman; instead,
of the soul governing the body.
She will perceive the cause of this
disorder in the history of the sin of
our first parents; and this history
will lead her to that of the Saviour,
who reconciles man to God. Such
is the foundation of religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>To make young people better
understand the mysteries, actions,
and precepts of Christ, we must
dispose them to read the Evangelists.
They must, therefore, be
early prepared to read the word of
God, as they are prepared to receive
the holy communion of the Sacraments.<a name="fnr_6" id="fnr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><sup><span class="small">6</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Remember, then, to place before
their eyes the Gospel, and the great
examples of antiquity; but not till
you are assured of their docility,
and simplicity of faith. Provided
you lay the foundation of humility,
submission, and an aversion to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>all suspicious singularity, you will
shew young people, with great benefit
and effect, every thing the
most perfect in the law of God, in
the institution of the Sacrament,
and in the practice of the ancient
church. I know that one cannot
hope to give these instructions, in
their full latitude, to all sorts of
children; I propose it only, in order
that we may make use of them,
as exactly as possible, according
to circumstances, time, and the
dispositions of them whom we
instruct.</p>

<p>Superstition, without doubt, is to
be avoided in the sex: but nothing
eradicates or prevents it better than
solid instruction: this instruction,
although it ought to be restrained
within proper bounds, and different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>from the studies of the learned,
produces greater effects than is
ordinarily imagined. A person
sometimes thinks himself to be
well informed, who in reality is
not so; and whose ignorance is
even so great that he is not in a
condition to feel what he wants in
order to know the foundation of
christianity.</p>

<p>Never suffer any thing to be
mixed with the faith, or the practices,
of religion, that is not drawn
from the Gospel. Carefully guard
children against certain abuses
which are but too common, and
which are, therefore, too apt to be
considered as points of present discipline
in the church. These errors
are not to be guarded against
without recurring to the source,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>and knowing the origin of the
usages and customs of holy men of
the primitive ages. Children who
are naturally too credulous, should
never be used to admit <i>lightly</i> certain
histories without authority; nor to
attach themselves to certain devotions
which are the offspring of an
indiscreet zeal. The true way of
instructing them in these subjects,
is, not to criticise those things
which have often been introduced
from pious notions, but to shew,
without passing a severe censure,
that they rest on no solid foundation.
Content yourself with omitting
these matters in your instructions
relating to the christian religion:
this silence will be sufficient,
at first, to enable children to form
a perfect idea of christianity, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>adding practical cautions: In
the course of your instructions, you
may prepare them, by degrees,
against the reasoning of <i>Calvinists</i>:
I think this will not be useless, as
we mingle every day with people
prejudiced in favour of Calvinistical
opinions, who deliver them in the
most familiar conversations.</p>

<p>Give children a taste for plain,
sensible, and edifying discourses&mdash;not
for those that are full of vain
and affected ornament: accustom
their imaginations to hear death
spoken of: to see, without perturbation,
a funeral pall&mdash;an open
grave&mdash;sick people who are dying,
and those already dead: if you can
do so without exposing them to
violent emotions of fear.</p>

<p>Nothing is more to be lamented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>than to see many people, who are
really religious, express a continued
dread of death: some absolutely
turn pale at finding the number
<i>thirteen</i> at table&mdash;or on having had
certain dreams&mdash;or having seen a
saltseller thrown down: the fear
arising from these imaginary presages
is a gross remnant of paganism:
make children see the folly
and absurdity of them. Although
women may not have the same opportunities
of shewing their courage,
as men, they ought nevertheless to
possess it. Cowardice is despicable,
every where, and has always bad
effects. A woman should know
how to resist vain alarms, and
should be firm against unforeseen
danger: let her cry and be agitated
on great occasions only, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>them let virtue be her chief support.
A christian of either sex should
never be a coward. The soul of a
christian, if one may so express it,
is the contempt of this life, and the
love of that which is to come.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The preceding observations have
sufficiently convinced us of the
importance of religion, both as it
affects our temporal and eternal
welfare. It now follows that we
instruct our children in the reading
of certain religious works, which
are not only considered to contain
wholesome doctrine, but which
may strengthen us in the opinions
we have cherished, and establish,
on an unshaken basis, "the reason
of the hope that is in us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>Without a pretty accurate information
of those <i>data</i>, on which our
religion is formed, we become subject
to the caprice or violence of
certain artful characters, who seldom
fail to perplex us, and undermine
many of the essential articles
of the christian faith; and who
ultimately leave us, after pulling
down the fair fabric we had built,
in all the misery of doubt and distraction.
The scriptures may be
said to be written with the finger
of God, on adamant which can never
perish: it is not in the power of
man to shake their authority, or to
divert their proper influence on a
sincere and pious mind. It is our
duty to be careful to comprehend
them thoroughly, to have as clear a
conception as possible of their more
mysterious parts, without harassing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>our minds if some things still remain
for future revelation. We
are not to censure what we do
not, at first, understand: reason and
knowledge are progressive&mdash;by degrees,
the mist of ignorance is
cleared away, and the sunshine of
intelligence succeeds. Above all,
let us not presumptuously conclude
certain passages to be irrecoverably
obscure, without consulting the
many able commentators who have
treated on them; but as the library
of a mother may not be extensively
theological, let us apply for information
to those pious pastors, and
studious men, who have made these
commentators their particular study.
If we are so eager to satisfy ourselves
and our children on the trifling topics
that ordinary conversation gives
rise to, how much more anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>should we be to obtain certainty and
truth on the important doctrines of
revelation!</p>

<p>I do not, however, mean that a
child is to be always reading the
bible, or sermons, or the catechism&mdash;nothing
is so injudicious. At her
tender years she can comprehend
little of the doctrinal points of scripture;
and besides, from such constant
habits of perusing religious
books, she may become fatigued
and disgusted, and turn an indifferent
ear to all future application
to them. Let us avoid making
children affectedly knowing in those
subjects which sometimes require
the mature years and profound study
of divines to comprehend. Nothing
is so disgusting as <i>cant</i>; as religious
quotations in young people, who
cannot, from their years and habits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>have formed an accurate idea either
of the meaning or application of
what they quote: such things savour
strongly of those <i>suspicious singularities</i>
which Fenelon is so anxious
to eradicate. The habit of quoting
scripture in young persons of either
sex, carries with it a pertness and
conceit, which all judicious parents
will be careful to discourage. Sacred
truths, or religious denunciations,
are not to be enforced by the
levity of youth; ignorance and hypocrisy
may be suspected where
such premature sanctity prevails.
If there be one thing more than
another, which destroys the simplicity
and harmless cheerfulness of
girls, it is the giving them notions
of puritannical gravity, and artificial
sobriety of behaviour: joy and elasticity
of spirits are not of themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>criminal. If we repress these innocent
ebullitions, by inculcating formality
and fastidiousness, we do as
much mischief to the growth of the
mind, as we should do to that of an
upright and proportionate body, by
the application of bandages and
ligatures.</p>

<p>No small degree of care and skill
is requisite for the direction of religious
studies in young people, and
especially in females; because the
opposite sex, which is always fond
of triumph, will be exerting every
art, and trying every expedient, to
weaken and subvert their arguments.
If reason or superior knowledge
fail, ridicule is resorted to;
and this, it must be confessed, has a
very strong effect on those young
people of a disposition above described.
In early years, religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>impressions should be kept solemnly
within the breast: they should be our
consolation in affliction, our hope
in distress, and the grand stimulus
to prayer and meditation. It is
well known, that from a premature
disclosure of crude religious sentiments,
ridicule and disgust are excited;
and many an amiable and
pious girl has suffered her principles
to be shaken, and her faith to be
overturned, by the buffoonery and
sarcasm of a weak and contemptible
antagonist. Let us endeavour to
guard against this; and to prevent
any ill effects arising from those
important studies, which should be
the ornament and solace of our
lives.</p>

<p>From no quarter can a child
receive religious instruction with
more benefit than from a <i>mother</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>and in proportion to the ignorance
or indiscretion of the latter, will be
that of the former. If a child is
unaccustomed to see books of religion
in her mother's library, she
can have but little curiosity to peruse
them; and if they at last be
obtruded on her, she will naturally
suspect the sincerity of her instructor,
who produces works which she
deems of the highest importance to
her pupil's welfare, but of which
she herself does not possess a single
copy. This evil is easily remedied,
if parents would only consider the
importance of religious education;
if, instead of crowding their shelves
with the flimsy productions of novelists
and romancers, they would
admit a few judicious works, which
treat of the evidences of the Christian
religion, and describe the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>doctrines by which it is upheld.
A portion of these studies might be
given at stated times, or as the inclination
of the child prompts, so
as not to make them too formal or
severe.</p>

<p>By the blessing of providence, we
have, in our own country, a great
abundance of excellent religious
tracts, which display the rise, progress
and establishment of the Christian
religion. Men of eminence
and piety&mdash;archbishops, bishops,
divines of every rank, and laymen,
have all contributed their talents,
with various ability and success, to
set forth the glory of the gospel,
and the truths of the kingdom of
heaven. Let us, therefore, attend
to the doctrines which these wise
and virtuous men, who have passed
a long and studious life, as labourers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>in the vineyard of Christ, have illustrated
and enforced. Let us not
indulge chimeras and conceits of
our own; but, with a diffidence and
timidity, listen to those opinions of
the learned and the good, whose
abilities and opportunities have best
entitled them to pronounce judgment.
Nothing should be so much
avoided as hasty and obstinate conclusions,
drawn from premises which
are not sufficiently understood.</p>

<p>In proportion to the breadth and
depth of the foundation, will be
the strength of the superstructure;
and if we take care to place in
the hands of young religious pupils,
such sound and serious books as
awaken piety, without kindling enthusiasm&mdash;as
lead and satisfy the
reason, without exciting vain and
sceptical curiosity&mdash;as strengthen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>the mind, and meliorate the heart,
without creating vanity, selfishness,
and hypocrisy&mdash;we shall, I ardently
conceive, have effected <i>that</i> which
it was our wish and duty to perform.</p>

<p>Agreeably to these principles
and reflections, I am desirous of
recommending such plain, perspicuous,
and sound works, as comprehend
every thing relating to the
elements, doctrines, and practice of
christianity; and such as may not
be difficult, or attended with great
expence, in the procuring.</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smallcaps">Ten Commandments</span>;
<i>and the 5th, 6th, and 7th Chapters of
the Gospel, according to St. Matthew</i>.
These important parts of holy writ
contain a fund of the most excellent
and essential doctrines for a
christian to know and practice;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>the primitive christians used to
commit them to memory, and instruct
their children in the application
of them.<a name="fnr_8" id="fnr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><sup><span class="small">8</span></sup></a></p>

<p>2. Dr. <span class="smallcaps">Doddridge's</span> <i>Three Sermons
on the Evidences of Christianity</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>separately published, from the particular
superintendance and recommendation
of the present Bishop of

is sold very cheap.</p>

<p>3. The (present) <span class="smallcaps">Bishop of London's</span>
<i>Summary of the Evidences of
Christianity, &amp;c.</i> which may be considered
one of the most useful, and
perspicuous treatises extant; it is
very cheap.</p>

<p>4. Mr. <span class="smallcaps">Addison's</span> <i>Treatise on the

have been first noticed) is a beautiful

worthy of the celebrity of its pious
and elegant author.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smallcaps">Grotius</span> <i>on the Truth of the
Christian Religion</i>. Every enlightened
mother will derive great pleasure
and benefit from the perusal of this
incomparable treatise. It has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>translated by John Clark, and lately
by the Rev. Mr. Madan, from the
Latin of the famous Grotius. Students
in divinity are usually examined
in the original when they
present themselves for holy orders.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smallcaps">Bishop Prettyman's</span> <i>Elements
of Christian Theology</i>. This is a
work of deserved repute, and will
be found greatly instructive. The
historical events of scripture are detailed
in an interesting manner, and
cannot fail to afford the most pleasing
conviction of the truth of what
is related. There has been an
abridgment of it in one large 8vo.
volume, by the Rev. Mr. Clapham.
The original is in 2 vols. 8vo.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smallcaps">Secker</span> (Archbishop) <i>on the
Catechism</i>: and <span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span> (Bishop)
<i>on the Sacrament</i>. These are truly
excellent treatises: their established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>celebrity renders no further recital
of them necessary in this place.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smallcaps">Sermons</span>: by <i>Dr. S. Clarke;

other excellent ones, whose enumeration
would swell the list to an
unnecessary size, may be perused
and meditated on with great advantage.
They are not selected in
rejection of others, but solely as
containing much sound and edifying
matter, which may bring forth
"sixty and an hundred fold."</p>

<p>9. <span class="smallcaps">Wilson's</span> (Bishop) <i>Bible, with

illustration of the sacred text
extant.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smallcaps">Gisborne's</span> <i>Duties of Women</i>,

performances, and reflect great credit
on the head and heart of the
distinguished and benevolent writer.</p>

<p>11. <i>The Whole Duty of Man.</i></p>

<p>12. <i>The Ladies' Calling.</i> These
two last works are from the same
anonymous author, whose publications
are, indeed, purer than gold&mdash;"yea,
than much fine gold."</p>

<p>Such are the works recommended
to the perusal and meditation of serious
and enlightened parents: and
such, it is hoped, will not bring
forth "bitter fruits."</p>

<p>There are moments of languor
and heaviness, of dulness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>despondency, to which the best of
mothers may be exposed, and which
may be removed, or relieved, by a
perusal of some of the foregoing
writers: in such moments, she will
know the full value of their works,
and will not repent the trouble or
expence incurred in the procuring
of them. She will then be convinced
that the common productions,
which amuse the ignorant
and the foolish, could not have
supplied the want of them; whether
in soothing the pangs which arise
from a deceased husband or child,
or in teaching her to bear up with
fortitude against the frowns of a
persecuting world. The balm of
consolation, which arises from these
studies, she will pour into the bosom
of a dutiful daughter; and the
knowledge that she has gained by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>experience, will be imparted to,
and grow up with, her rising posterity.</p>

<p>Let it always be impressed on our
minds, that if we are so anxious to
procure costly furniture, or splendid
apparel, which the moth eats, or
the thief steals, how much more is
it our duty to devote a comparatively
trifling sum towards the acquisition
of those mental treasures,
of which neither treachery nor
violence can dispossess us, and
which fit us, by degrees, for the
eternal mansions of happiness and
rest.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that the
female sex is more liable to fanaticism
than the male; the history,
however, of religious sectaries, does
not authorise this observation: instances
of violence and mad persecution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>may be adduced, in which
females have taken a very subordinate
part, or indeed none at all;
and while the examples of Athanasius
and Arius are fresh in the memory,
we need not resort to another.
That the warmth and susceptibility
of a female mind renders it exposed
to strong impressions, before the
judgment begins to operate, cannot
be disputed. What pleases on the
first impression is not easily eradicated;
and we conclude that to be
true, which flatters some previous
opinion, or favour some secret bias.
Error, thus introduced, is not extirpated
without difficulty: and if to
the pliancy and sensibility of a
female mind, we add, that opportunities
are seldom offered of going
into deep critical investigations,
or listening to opposite opinions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>which are founded on reason and
experience, it will not appear surprising
that women are sometimes
warm in their religious sentiments,
and slow and reluctant to abandon
them.</p>

<p>Hence follows the necessity of a
<i>proper religious instruction</i>&mdash;of an
adherence to those doctrines and
opinions, which, on a careful survey
of the many that have agitated
mankind, seem to be the best calculated
for ensuring our present
and future welfare. In thus offering
advice on so important a subject,
the translator has ventured to
advance certain sentiments, and to
recommend certain works, which
in his humble apprehension, appeared
likely to be productive of
some assistance and advantage.
When he recommends a conformity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>to the tenets of the <span class="smallcaps">established
church of this country</span>,
he does so from a conscientious
conviction of its purity and
excellence; from a recollection of
the many great and good men who
have lived and died in its cause;
and whose works remain a glorious
monument of their diligence, piety,
and learning. While reason, integrity,
and virtue, have any influence
on the human character, while practical
good is acknowledged to be
superior to plausible theory, so long
shall the luminous and illustrious
divines of the English Church rise
above all the pretensions of fanatical
and self-inspired teachers, who turn
the word of God into craft, and use
the name of Jesus with their lips,
while their hearts are estranged
from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>That the foregoing sentiments
may tend to promote true sober-minded
religion&mdash;to adorn the female
character with those charms
which arise from the substance, and
not the form, of piety&mdash;to excite
cheerfulness without levity&mdash;seriousness
without despondency&mdash;and
happiness in this present state without
groundless anxieties of the
future&mdash;is the earnest and ardent
wish of their author.</p>

<div class="med"><p><a name="fn_7" id="fn_7"></a><a href="#fnr_7">7.</a> The present original chapter is substituted for that
of Fenelon, as being more applicable, in the opinion of
the translator, to the generality of female readers; at
least to those of his own country.</p>

<p class="med"><a name="fn_8" id="fn_8"></a><a href="#fnr_8">8.</a> Perhaps it may be advisable to have them printed

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Remarks on Ordinary Defects among Girls.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>We are now to speak of the care
and attention which are requisite
to preserve girls from many defects
to which they are too commonly
addicted. They are oftentimes
brought up in so effeminate and
timid a manner, as to be rendered
incapable of a firm and regular
conduct. At first there is much
affectation, which afterwards become
habitual, in those ill-founded
fears, and in those tears, which are
so cheaply and plentifully bestowed.
A contempt of such affectations
would operate greatly in correcting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>them; as they are in a considerable
degree the offspring of vanity.</p>

<p>They should also be repressed in
the indulgence of too violent
friendships, little jealousies, excessive
compliments, and flatteries:
all these things spoil them, and accustom
them to imagine that dryness
and austerity belongs to every
thing which is serious and grave.
We should strive to effect this, so
that their common mode of parlance
be short and precise. A
good understanding consists in retrenching
all superfluous discourse,
and in saying much in few words:
whereas, the greater part of women
say little in many words. They
mistake facility of utterance and
vivacity of imagination for good
sense: they make no selection of
their thoughts: they observe no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>order in regard to the things they
have to explain: they are passionate
in every thing they utter, and passion
produces loquacity. Nothing
very excellent can be expected of a
woman, if she is not obliged to reflect
on consequences, to examine
her thoughts, to explain them in a
precise manner, and afterwards to
be silent.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which
greatly contributes to the loquacity
of women, is, that they are naturally
artificial, and use a <i>roundabout</i>
manner to arrive at the proper
end. They are fond of <i>finesse</i>:
and how is it possible they should
be otherwise, when they are ignorant
of a more prudent method&mdash;and
when it is usually the first thing
which example has taught them?
They have a soft and ductile nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>which enables them easily to play
a part in every thing: tears cost
them nothing: their passions are
lively, and their knowledge limited:
hence it is that they neglect nothing
to come off successful&mdash;and that
they admire certain methods, which
to a serious and prudent woman
would appear very exceptionable:
they seldom stop to enquire whether
such a thing is desirable, but are
anxious and indefatigable only in
obtaining it. Add to this, they are
timid and full of what is called
"<i>mauvais honte</i>;" which is another
source of dissimulation. The method
of preventing so great an evil,
never to put them under a necessity
of finessing, but accustom them to
declare ingenuously their sentiments
upon every lawful topic. Let them
be at liberty to express their <i>ennui</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>whenever they feel it: and let them
never be subjected to feign an
admiration of certain persons or
certain books, which in reality displease
them.</p>

<p>Sometimes a mother is prejudiced
against a governess, and undertakes
the management of the child
herself, while the daughter cunningly
acts contrary to her taste.
When children are so wretched
that they are under the necessity of
disguising their sentiments, the way
of extricating them from such a dilemma,
is, to instruct them solidly
in the maxims of true prudence&mdash;as
one perceives that the method of
correcting a taste for novels and
romances, is, by exciting a turn for
useful and agreeable histories. If
you do not encourage a rational
curiosity, they will entertain an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>irrational one&mdash;in like manner, if
you do not form their minds on
the principles of true prudence,
they will become attached to falsehood,
which is, in fact, <i>finesse</i>.</p>

<p>Shew them, by examples, how
one is able, without duplicity, to
be discreet, foresighted, and attached
to <i>legitimate</i> means of succeeding.
Tell them that prudence consists
chiefly in speaking little&mdash;in entertaining
a greater distrust of oneself
than of others, and not in uttering
false sentiments, and playing a
deceitful part. An upright conduct,
and a general reputation for
integrity, begets more confidence
and esteem, and, in the end, even
more temporal advantages, than
perverse and suspicious habits.
How much does this judicious
rectitude of conduct distinguish a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>person, and render her fit for the
most important undertakings!</p>

<p>But add, how base and contemptible
is <i>premeditated finesse</i>! it is
either an account of some trifle
which one is ashamed to mention,
or it must be considered as a pernicious
passion. When one wishes for
that which it is lawful to wish for,
the request is made openly&mdash;and it
is sought for in a direct and proper
method, with moderation. What
is there more delightful and agreeable,
than to be sincere? always
tranquil&mdash;always content&mdash;having
nothing to fear or to feign? On the
contrary, a dissimulating character
is always in agitation&mdash;remorse&mdash;and
danger&mdash;and under the deplorable
necessity of covering <i>one
finesse</i> by substituting an <i>hundred
others</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>With all these shameful disquietudes,
artificial characters never
escape that misery from which they
are constantly flying&mdash;sooner or
later their <i>real</i> character will appear.
If the world has been their
dupe in some single action, it will
not continue so during the whole of
their lives: oftentimes they are the
dupes of those whom they wished
to deceive: for there is sometimes
an appearance of being dazzled by
them, and they think themselves
beloved&mdash;at the very moment, perhaps,
when they are despised. At
least they cannot prevent suspicion&mdash;and
can any thing be more
contrary to the rational interests
of a prudent woman, than to see
herself always suspected? Unfold
these things by degrees&mdash;according
as opportunity, necessity, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>bent of your pupil's intellect, may
suggest.</p>

<p>Observe, however, that cunning
(or <i>finesse</i>) is always the offspring
of a base heart and narrow-minded
spirit. In proportion as we wish
to conceal our views we become
cunning&mdash;being convinced that we
are not as we ought to be&mdash;or,
that, seeking for lawful objects, we
adopt unworthy means of obtaining
them&mdash;which arises from our
ignorance in seeking such objects.
Make children remark the impertinence
of certain artifices that they
see practised&mdash;the contempt which
it draws on those practising them&mdash;and
lastly, make them ashamed of
themselves when you detect them
in some dissimulation. As they
grow up, deprive them of what
they love, when they wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>obtain it by <i>artifice</i>&mdash;but declare,
that they shall possess it when they
ask <i>openly</i>: do not be afraid even
of indulging their little weaknesses,
in order to give them an opportunity
and the courage of shewing them.
False shame is the most dangerous
of evils and the most difficult to
cure; and this too, if great care be
not taken, will render all others
irremediable.</p>

<p>Paint, in their proper colours,
those infamous artifices by which
they would wish to deceive their
neighbour without having the reproach
of deceiving him: there is
more perfidy and knavery in these
refinements, than in common artifices.
Some people, one may say,
boldly practice deception&mdash;but
wretches of the preceding description,
add novelty and disguise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>authorise it. Tell a child that <span class="smallcaps">God</span>
<i>is truth itself</i>&mdash;that it is mocking
<i>him</i> when we jest at truth in our
discourse&mdash;which should be precise
and correct, and should consist in
few words, that truth be not violated.</p>

<p>Be on your guard not to imitate
those who applaud children, when
they have discovered sharpness of
intellect by some <i>finesse</i>. Far from
supposing these tricks pretty and
diverting, check them severely&mdash;and
manage it so, that all their artifice
may end unsuccessfully, and
experience at last may disgust them
with it. In praising them for such
and such faults, we, in fact, persuade
them that <i>ability</i> and <i>deception</i>
are one and the same thing.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_X" id="ch_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>The Vanity of Beauty and Dress.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing is more to be dreaded
among young girls, than <i>vanity</i>&mdash;as
they are born with a violent desire
to please. Those roads which
conduct <i>men</i> to authority and fame
being shut to <i>them</i>; they strive to
be recompensed by the charms of
intellect and person: hence flows
their conversation so soft and so
insinuating&mdash;hence it is that they
aspire, as well to beauty, as to all
the exterior graces, and become
passionately fond of dress. A turban
or bandeau is of the greatest
importance in their estimation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>This excess is carried farther in our
country<a name="fnr_10" id="fnr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><sup><span class="small">10</span></sup></a> than in any other. That
volatile disposition so remarkable
among us, causes a continual variety
of fashions: so that, to the love of
dress is added the love of novelty,
which has strange charms for some
people. These two follies united,
reverses all orders and conditions,
and corrupts all manners. As soon
as <i>certain rules</i> are done away in
respect to our clothes and furniture,
the same irregularity prevails in our
conditions. Public authority cannot
settle a "table of particulars:"<a name="fnr_11" id="fnr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><sup><span class="small">11</span></sup></a>
every one, therefore, chooses according
to his money; or rather,
without money, according to his
ambition and vanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>This passion for splendor ruins
families; and the ruin of families
brings with it a corruption of manners.
On the one hand, it begets,
in persons of mean extraction, a
passion for a large fortune (which
religion assures us is sinful); on the
other, among people of quality who
find their resources exhausted, it
produces mean and dirty practices
in order to support their extravagance:
hence, honor, fidelity, integrity,
and benevolence, (even
towards their nearest relatives,) are
extinguished for ever!</p>

<p>These evils arise from the influence
of vain women in directing
the fashions; they ridicule those,
as antiquated dames, who wish to
preserve the gravity and simplicity
of ancient manners.</p>

<p>Be particularly zealous, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>to make girls understand how much
more estimable is that honor which
flows from an upright conduct and
sound capacity, than that which arises
from the elegance and splendor of
dress. Beauty, you may say, deceives
the possessor of it much more
than it does those whom it dazzles:
it agitates and intoxicates the soul;
we are more foolishly idolising ourselves,
than the most passionate lovers
the object of their affection. A few
years only make the difference between
a beautiful and ordinary woman.
Beauty is not desirable unless
it produces advantageous marriages:
and how should it effect this, unsupported
by merit and virtue? A
girl, merely beautiful, can only
hope to be united to a giddy young
man, with whom she is pretty certain
of misery: on the contrary, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>good sense and modesty would
cause her to be sought for by prudent
men, sensible of such solid
qualifications. Those whose fame
consists only in their beauty, soon
become ridiculous: they approach,
without perceiving it, to a certain
age in which their charms begin to
fade; still, however, indulging the
dear delusion of self-gratification,
when the world has long ago been
disgusted with their vanity. In
short, it is as unreasonable to be attached
<i>solely to beauty</i>, as to concentrate
all merit in strength of body;
a maxim, which barbarians and
savages only inculcate.</p>

<p>From beauty let us pass to <span class="smallcaps">dress</span>.
True grace does not depend on a
vain and affected exterior; although
propriety, and some little skill may
be shewn in our necessary clothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>But after all, these silks or satins,
which may be pretty enough, can
never be considered as ornaments
which <i>confer</i> beauty.</p>

<p>I would even make young girls
remark that noble simplicity which
appears in the drapery of <i>statues</i>, and
in many figures which yet remain
of Grecian and Roman <i>costume</i>.
They should contemplate the superiority
of hair negligently tied behind,
and of the broad folds of a
full and floating drapery. It would
also be as well for them to hear
painters and connoisseurs, who possess
a true taste for the antique, converse
on these subjects.</p>

<p>In proportion as their understanding
rose superior to the prejudices
of fashion, they would hold
in contempt those artificial modes
of twisting and curling the hair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>and all the paraphernalia of a fashionable
woman. I am aware
that one should not wish them to
assume an entirely-antique costume
of dress, which would be extravagant,
and sometimes indecent:
but they might, without the affectation
of singularity, model their
taste on that simplicity of attire,
which is so noble, so delightful,
and in all respects conformable to
the manners of christians. Make
them observe often, and by times,
the vanity and, frivolousness of that
mind which is sacrificed to the
inconstancy of fashion.<a name="fnr_12" id="fnr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><sup><span class="small">12</span></sup></a> True
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>grace follows, but never does violence
to, nature.</p>

<p>Fashion, however, soon destroys
itself: it is perpetually aiming at
perfection, and never finds it; at
least, it never stops when it <i>has</i>
found it. It would be reasonable
enough if all changing and alteration
were to cease after having
found perfection, comprising both
elegance and utility: but to change
for the sake of changing, appears
very much like sacrificing true politeness
and good taste to inconstancy
and confusion! Fashions are
frequently founded on mere caprice.
Women are the sole arbitrators of
them; and it being difficult to say,
who is to be believed or imitated,
the most giddy and least informed
seduce and influence the rest. They
neither choose nor leave any thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>according to rule: it is quite sufficient
if one thing, though useful,
has been long adopted: it ought
to be discarded: and another thing,
though perfectly ridiculous, but
having the charm of novelty, is
immediately substituted in its place,
and becomes the admiration of all.
After having laid a proper foundation,
describe to them the rules of
<i>christian modesty</i>. We learn, you
will say, that man is born in the
corruption of sin: his body, exposed
to a contagious malady, is an inexhaustible
source of temptation to
his soul. Our Saviour has taught
us to place all our virtue in fear
and distrust of ourselves. Would
you, we may exclaim, hazard your
own soul and that of your neighbour
by the indulgence of a foolish
vanity? Look, therefore, with horror
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>upon the exposure of the bosom
and all other indecencies! When
these absurdities are even committed
without any premeditated passion,
they, at least, savour strongly
of vanity, and betray an unbridled
desire to please. Does this variety
justify, before God and man, so rash
and scandalous a conduct, and so
likely to be imitated by others?
This blind passion of pleasing, is it
conformable to a christian character,
which should consider every thing
as idolatrous, that perverts the love
of God, and kindles the contempt
of his creatures? When such giddy
female characters strive to please&mdash;what
is their real object? Is it not
to excite the passions of men? And
can they regulate these passions
when in their possession? If women
go too far, ought they not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>be answerable for the consequences?
And do they not always go too far,
when their minds have been but
little enlightened? You are absolutely
preparing a subtile and deadly
poison, and pouring it on the spectators
beneath, and yet you imagine
yourself <i>innocent</i>! When you address
your pupils in this strong
manner, add to it, the example of
those whom modesty has recommended,
and those whom indelicacy
has covered with dishonor.
Above every thing, never suffer
children's minds to be filled with
ideas that suit not with their condition.
Repress severely all their
whims and fantasies&mdash;shew them
the inevitable danger which follows&mdash;and
how much they make
themselves despised by wise and
discreet people, in thus assuming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>a character which does not belong
to them.</p>

<p>What now remains to be effected,
is, the managing of children of high
and animated spirit. If care be
not taken of this, when they have
any vivacity, they intrigue: they
wish to speak on every topic:
they decide on works the least calculated
for their capacity, and affect,
through extreme delicacy, to
be easily fatigued and overpowered.
A girl should never speak but when
necessity prompts: and then, with
an air of deference and doubt:
they should never even discuss subjects
above the level of a common
understanding, how well soever
versed in them. Let a child possess
a good memory and vivacity&mdash;shew
pleasant little turns, and a facility
of <i>graceful</i> eloquence&mdash;all these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>qualifications she may have in
common with a great number of
other stupid and contemptible women.
But an exact and uniform
conduct&mdash;an equal and regulated
spirit&mdash;when to be silent, and when
to speak&mdash;these rare qualifications
will indeed distinguish her among
her sex. As to squeamish delicacy
and affectation of <i>ennui</i>, she must
be repressed in both&mdash;by shewing
her that a correct taste and good
understanding consist in accommodating
oneself to every thing in
proportion to its utility.</p>

<p>Good sense and virtue are alone
estimable. These will teach her
to consider disgust and <i>ennui</i>, not
as a commendable delicacy, but as
the weakness of a diseased mind.</p>

<p>Since one must sometimes associate
with gross characters, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>mingle in occupations not altogether
congenial&mdash;reason, which is
the only real delicacy to be indulged,
should instruct us to accommodate
ourselves according to
every emergency. An understanding
which knows in what true politeness
consists, and practises it, but
which aspires to objects beyond
it, in the hope of enjoying more
solid attainments&mdash;is infinitely superior
to delicate and merely polite
characters, who are subject to be
disgusted by their own nicety and
refined taste.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Instruction of Women in their Duties.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>Let us now discuss, in detail,
those particulars of which it is the
duty of a woman to be well informed.
What are her employments?
She is charged with the education
of her children&mdash;of the boys, till a
certain age&mdash;of the girls till they
are married; of the conduct, manners,
and morals of her domestic
attendants; of the whole detail of
household expenses; of the means
of managing every thing with credit
and economy; and sometimes, of
the regulation of farms and the
receipt of profits which arise from
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>Women, as well as men, should
adapt their pursuits in literature
and science to their situations and
functions in life; and according to
their occupations, should be their
studies. We must, therefore, confine
the instruction of women to
the foregoing circumstances. But
a curious woman, wishing to pry
into every thing, may fancy that
these instructions will confine her
curiosity within narrow limits indeed&mdash;she
is mistaken, because she
knows not the importance and extent
of the particulars in which I
wish her to be instructed.</p>

<p>What discernment is necessary to
know the disposition and genius of
each of her children! to find out
the proper mode of conduct so as
to discover their humours, inclinations,
and talents! to check those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>passions which are born with them,
to inculcate good maxims, and to
cure them of their errors! What
prudence should she possess, to acquire
and preserve authority over
them, without forfeiting their confidence
and esteem! Has she not
also need of observing and thoroughly
knowing those people
whom she places near them? Undoubtedly
she has: a mother of a
family ought to be completely instructed
in religion, and to possess a
mature firm mind, adapted to, and
experienced in, the government of
her children.</p>

<p>Can it be supposed that women
ought <i>not</i> to be explicitly and <i>formally
instructed</i> in these duties, because
they naturally fall into them
during the lives of their husbands,
who are generally engaged in business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>from home? Or, if widows, they
still attend to them more closely?
St. Paul generally attaches the salvation
of mothers to the good education
of daughters; for by these,
he assures them, they will be
saved.</p>

<p>I do not here take upon me to
explain all that a woman ought to
know for the education of her
daughters; because such a memorial
would make them sufficiently
feel the extent of that knowledge
which it is their duty to obtain.</p>

<p>To the government of families,
add <span class="smallcaps">economy</span>. The greater part
of women neglect it as a mean consideration,
fit only for country folks
or farmers; or, at best, for innkeepers
and housekeepers. Women
nursed in the lap of affluence,
luxury, and idleness, not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>neglect, but despise, this domestic
virtue; and seem to be forgetful of
a middle state between the rusticity
of a peasant, and the wildness of a
Canadian savage. If you speak to
them of the sale of corn, of the
cultivation of lands, of the different
kinds of revenue, of the receipt or
raising of rents and other seignoral
rights, of the best method of laying
out farms, and appointing receivers,
they imagine that you wish to reduce
them to occupations, unworthy
of their rank and character.</p>

<p>Ignorance is the offspring of their
contempt for economy. The ancient
Greeks and Romans, so distinguished
for their ability and politeness,
studied economy with the
utmost care: some of their finest
writers, from their own experience,
have composed works which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>still possess, and in which they give
an account of the latest improvements
of agriculture. It is well
known that even their conquerors
did not disdain to work in the field;
and instances have come down to
us in which the splendor of a triumph
was followed by the care and
conduct of a plough. All this is
so foreign to our own customs and
manners, that we should not credit
it if it were not supported by historical
truth. But is it not natural
that the defence or augmentation
of a country should be subordinate
to the ultimate object of cultivating
it peaceably? Of what advantage
is victory, if it enable us not to
gather the fruits of peace? After
all, solidity of intellect consists in
wishing to be exactly informed of
the way in which those things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>operate, which constitute the foundations
of human life: the greatest
occurrences are regulated by this
principle. The strength and felicity
of a country consists not in
the possession of provinces badly
cultivated, but in the enjoyment
of those productions of the earth
which are necessary and sufficient
for the sustenance of a numerous
people.</p>

<p>Without doubt it requires a more
elevated and comprehensive genius
to be instructed and well informed
in all the particulars relating to
economy, and to be thereby able
to regulate an entire family (which
is a little republic), than to play,
talk of the fashions, and be expert
in all the little polite arts of conversation.
That is a contemptible
mind indeed, which aspires not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>beyond perfection in the talent of
conversation: one sees, on all sides,
women whose discourse is full
of sound sense and solid maxims&mdash;while
this conduct is replete with
frivolousness and absurdity&mdash;the
effect of not applying by times to
better pursuits.</p>

<p>But take care of the opposite defect:
women run a risk of being
in extremes in every thing. It
would be advisable for them, from
their infancy, to have the management
of some trifling affair&mdash;to
keep accounts&mdash;to see the mode of
bargaining for what they purchase,
and to know how each thing should
be made to answer a good use.
Take care, also, that economy
borders not on avarice: shew them,
in detail, all the absurdities attendant
on this latter passion. Tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>them that "avarice gains little,
and dishonors itself greatly." A
reasonable mind will seek, in a
frugal and laborious life, only how
to avoid the shame and injustice
attached to a prodigal and ruinous
conduct. Superfluous expenses are
to be retrenched as they enable a
person to devote a portion of money
to satisfy the claims of benevolence,
friendship, and charity: great
gain is frequently the result of seasonable
forbearance: good order
and management, and not sordid
savings, are the source of profit.
Do not fail to expose the gross
error of those female economists
who pertinaceously forbid a mold
candle, while they suffer their
whole affairs to be subjected to the
knavery or rapacity of a steward.
Respect propriety as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>economy. Accustom young people
to do nothing in a slovenly and
disorderly manner, and to remark
the least disarrangement in a house.
Make them also sensible that nothing
so much contributes to propriety
and economy, as the keeping
of every thing in its proper place.
This rule appears too trifling to
mention; nevertheless it goes a
great way if it be rigidly observed.
For instance&mdash;are you in want of
any thing? not a moment is lost in
finding it&mdash;there is neither trouble,
disputation, nor embarrassment attending
its search: you put your
hand immediately upon it, and
when satisfied, replace it in the
situation where you found it. This
<i>nice order</i> constitutes one of the
essential parts of propriety; and
every eye is struck with the neat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>appearance of so exact an arrangement.
Moreover, a particular place
allotted to each article, not only
has a pleasing appearance, but, in
reality, tends to the preservation of
that article. It is <i>used</i> less than it
otherwise would be&mdash;it is not so
frequently spoilt by accident&mdash;it is
even more respected and treasured:
for example, a vase would never be
covered with dust, or become liable
to be broken, if it were instantly
put away after being done with.
A passion for arranging things
orderly, produces a love of neatness;
and this will appear very advantageous,
if it be considered that
by such means servants are never
encouraged in idleness and confusion.
Again, something is gained
by making their service prompt
and easy, and depriving us of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>opportunity of becoming impatient
and impetuous, which is generally
the case when things cannot be
found from confusion and irregularity.</p>

<p>At the same time, avoid the excess
of politeness and propriety. When
propriety is within moderation, it is
a virtue; but when we consult too
much our own tastes and fancies, it
is converted into a littleness of
mind. Good taste rejects excessive
delicacy: it treats little matters <i>as</i>
little ones, and is not hurt at any
unpleasant consequences resulting
therefrom. Ridicule, before children,
those knick-knacks and gewgaws,
of which some women are
prodigiously fond, and which lead
them insensibly into unwarrantable
expenses. Accustom young people
to a propriety and decorum which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>is simple and easy of practice&mdash;shew
them the best way of managing
things&mdash;but shew them also the
advantage of slighting them. Tell
them how paltry and contemptible
it is to grumble if a dish be badly
seasoned, if a curtain be unevenly
folded, or a chair be too high or
too low.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly better to be
naturally coarse, than to have an
overweening delicacy in matters of
little moment. This pernicious
delicacy, if not repressed in women
of understanding, is more dangerous
as it regards conversation than
every thing else: to females of this
stamp, the greater part of mankind
appears insipid or fatiguing: the
least deviation from politeness is
monstrous: and they are always
ridiculing and disgusted. Make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>such women know betimes that
nothing is so injudicious as judging
superficially of people by their
manners, instead of examining the
very bottom of their intellect, their
sentiments and useful qualities.
Convince them, by a variety of
proofs, how much a country woman,
with a coarse or even ridiculous
manner, but with a good
heart and sound understanding, is
more estimable than a courtisan,
who, under an acquired politeness,
hides an ungrateful and unjust
heart, capable of every meanness
and dissimulation. Observe also,
that those characters are always
weak which incline to idleness and
disgust. There is no one whose
conversation is so bad, as that
some good may not, occasionally,
be drawn from it; and although a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>person at liberty would prefer
choosing the best characters to
converse with, yet there is some
consolation, when reduced to converse
with inferior characters, that
we may make them talk on subjects
that they understand, from which,
perhaps, some information may be
gained. But let us now return to
those particulars in which a girl
should be instructed.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XII" id="ch_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Continuation of the Duties of Women.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>To the duties previously enumerated,
may be added the art of
<i>choosing and retaining servants</i>. We
should employ such as have honor
and religion: their offices
should be distinctly ascertained:
the time and trouble which each
thing requires, the manner of doing
it well, and the expense attending
it, should also be considered. It
would be absurd (for instance) to
find fault with a servant if you
wished her to dress any thing
quicker than it could be dressed;
and if you have not some knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>of the quantity and price of
the ingredients which compose
dishes, you will be liable to become
the dupe or the scourge of
your domestics; so that a knowledge
of these matters is essential
to a mistress of a family.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to know their
humours, to manage their tempers,
and to regulate in a christian-like
manner this little household republic,
which is, in general, sufficiently
turbulent. Authority, is absolutely
essential in this respect; for the
more unreasonable servants are, the
more they should be made obedient
by fear: but as they are your
brethren in Christ, and members
of his kingdom, a rigid authority
should never be exercised towards
them, unless previous persuasion
is found to fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>Strive, therefore, to be beloved
by your servants, without descending
to low familiarity; enter not
into conversation with them, but at
the same time do not be backward
in occasionally speaking, with kindness
and affability, respecting their
wants and concerns; and let them
be assured of finding in you a
compassionate counsellor. Do not
check them too eagerly in their
faults&mdash;appear neither surprised nor
dissatisfied, provided you think
them not incorrigible: let them
gently hear reason; and submit
frequently to little losses by their
service, that you may be able coolly
to convince them, that it is not
from impetuosity and chagrin that
you correct them, but rather for
their own, than your, interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>It would be no easy task to accustom
<i>young women of fashion</i> to
adopt a conduct, at once so amiable
and benevolent. The impatience
and ardor of youth, united with the
false idea they are apt to entertain
of their birth, often induce them
to treat their domestics pretty nearly
the same as they do their horses&mdash;they
imagine that servants are any
thing but what they really are&mdash;and
made solely for the convenience
of their masters. Endeavour to
shew how revolting these principles
are to modesty in yourself, and
to humanity towards your neighbour.</p>

<p>Let it be comprehended that
men are not born to be slaves&mdash;that
it is a brutal error to suppose
our fellow mortals are created to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>flatter our laziness and pride; that
servitude being established against
the natural equality of mankind, we
should endeavour to soften it as
much as possible; that masters
themselves, though above their
servants in situation, are not free
from errors, and therefore should
not expect an exemption from
them in domestics; especially as
they have not had the benefit of
instruction and good example&mdash;and
lastly, if servants become good for
nothing by serving ill, masters also,
frequently, become so, by being
served well: for a facility of accommodation
in every wish, and
an immediate gratification in every
desire, only softens and effeminates
the soul, and renders it peevish
and irritable under every trifling
inconvenience.</p>

<p>N<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>othing is so well calculated to
effect this domestic government, as
the being <i>early</i> initiated in it. Give
a young woman something to manage
herself, on condition of her
rendering you some account of it:
this confidence will delight her,
for youth is highly pleased when it
is thought worthy of confidence,
and capable of doing serious business.
The example of Queen Margaret
is a fine illustration of this.
That princess informs us, in her
memoirs, that the most sensible
pleasure she ever experienced, was
in seeing the queen, her mother, begin
to converse with her, when she
was very young, as with a person of
years and maturity&mdash;she felt transported
with joy on entering into
the secrets of state with the queen
and her brother the Duke of Anjou,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>reflecting that, not long ago, she
had been immersed in the pastimes
of children. Overlook the faults
of a child in her first attempts at
these things, and sacrifice something
in order that she may ultimately
gain instruction. Make her
sensible, in a mild manner, of what
she should have said or done, to
avoid the inconveniencies into
which she has been betrayed. Relate
to her what has happened to
yourself, and be not anxious to
suppress faults, similar to her own,
which you committed when young.
Thus will you inspire her with
confidence; without which, all
education is but a formal wearisome
task.</p>

<p>Teach a girl to read and write
correctly. It is a shameful thing,
but too common, to see women of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>understanding and good breeding,
who cannot accurately pronounce
what they read: either they stammer,
or have a sort of singing or
whine in their reading&mdash;whereas
good reading consists in a simple
and natural, but firm and even, tone
of voice. They are, moreover,
sometimes grossly deficient in orthography;
either as to the manner
of forming, or connecting, their
letters when writing: at any rate
they should be taught to write
straight, and in a character neat and
legible.</p>

<p>A girl should know the grammar
of her own language; not, however,
that she is to be taught by
rule, as schoolboys are taught the
Latin language&mdash;but that she be
used to distinguish the different
tenses, in an obvious and easy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>manner; to make use of proper
terms; and to explain their
thoughts, in a way, at once clear
and concise. By these means you
will enable her one day to teach
her own children to speak accurately
without previous study. It
is well known that in ancient
Rome, the mother of the Gracchi
contributed greatly, by a sound
education, to improve the language
of her children, who became afterwards
such eminent characters.</p>

<p>Females should also be instructed
in the first four rules of arithmetic;
namely, in addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division; which
will be of essential use to them in
keeping accounts. This, though a
very important, is a very disagreeable,
occupation with many people;
but early habits, joined to a facility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>of quick reckoning, by the help of
rules, will overcome every antipathy,
and enable us to arrange the
most perplexed accounts. No one
can be ignorant that a correct
method of keeping them is often
productive of good order throughout
an establishment.</p>

<p>It will be prudent also to give
them a knowledge of the principal
rules of justice: for example, of
the difference between a gift and a
thing bequeathed; between a contract,
an entail, and a copartnership
of inheritance; the general
rules of law, or the particular customs
of a country, which render
these things valid; what is exclusive,
and what is common, property;
what goods are moveable,
and what immoveable. When
women marry, they will find a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>knowledge of these things of great
importance to them.</p>

<p>But, at the same time, convince
them, how incapable they are of entering
deeply into the subtilties of
law: how much the law itself, by
the weakness of human reason, is
subject to obscurity, and doubtful
rules: how it varies: how uncertain
every thing is that depends upon
judicial decision, clear and upright
as it may seem: how ruinous and
insupportable is the law's delay,
even in the most obvious cases.<a name="fnr_13" id="fnr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><sup><span class="small">13</span></sup></a></p>

<p>All this is of importance for
women to know, in order to abate
their fondness for lawsuits, and
to prevent their trusting implicitly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>to counsellors, who would
dissuade them from peaceful measures.
When they are widows, or
mistresses of their estates in any
other way, they may do well to
hear their agents, but not blindly
follow them. They should act
with the utmost caution in any
suits their agents may advise them
to undertake; and consult men of
greater ability, and such as are
more inclined to recommend the
advantages of compromise: in short
they should be assured, that the
best ability in law causes, is, to
foresee the mischiefs of them,
and to know how they may be
avoided.</p>

<p>Young women of rank and large
fortune should be acquainted with
the duties more particularly attached
to great estates: tell them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>therefore, what should be done, to
prevent the abuses, violence, tricks
and treacheries so common in the
country; how they ought to establish
little schools and charitable
societies, for the relief of the sick
and needy: shew them also the
handicraft trades, that may be set
on foot in certain countries, to help
the poor; and above all, how they
may be taught useful knowledge
and christian conduct; this however
will lead to a detail too long
to be here discussed.</p>

<p><a name="fnr_14" id="fnr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><sup><span class="small">14</span></sup></a>These instructions having been
attended to, I think it may not be
improper to allow young women,
according to their leisure and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>capacity, the perusal of profane
or classical writers, provided there
be nothing in them to inflame or
mislead the passions: these will be
a means also of giving them a distaste
for plays and romances. Put
into their hands, therefore, the
Greek and Roman historians; they
will there see prodigies of courage
and disinterestedness: let them be
acquainted likewise with the history
of their <i>own country</i>, which has
its excellencies also, and with that
of the neighbouring or foreign
countries, judiciously written. All
this will serve to enlarge their understandings,
and to fill their hearts
with noble sentiments, provided
you guard against vanity and affectation.
It is generally thought a
necessary part of a good education,
for a young lady of rank to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>taught the Italian and Spanish
languages: for my part I see no
use in these acquirements, unless
the lady is to be connected with
some Spanish or Italian princess:<a name="fnr_15" id="fnr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><sup><span class="small">15</span></sup></a>
besides these two languages often
lead them to books that are dangerous,
and which might increase
the faults to which they are liable;
there is much to lose, and little to
be gained, by these studies. Latin
might be of some use; even in cultivating
the elegancies of language,
they will find the Latin more perfect
than the Italian and Spanish, which
are full of quaint conceits, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>wantonness of imagination bordering
on extravagance: Latin however
should be taught to young women
of good judgment and discreet
conduct only; who will set no
greater value on this study than
it deserves; who will renounce
all vain curiosity, and have no
other view than their own edification.</p>

<p>I would allow also, but with
great care, the perusal of works of
eloquence and poetry, if I saw they
had a taste for them, and solidity of
judgment enough to confine themselves
to their real use: but fearful
of agitating too much their lively
imaginations, I would have the
utmost caution observed in this
respect: every thing that may
awaken the sentiments of love,
seems to me the more dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>in proportion as it is softened and
disguised.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Music</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Painting</span> require the
same precautions; all these arts are
of the same taste and tendency: as
to music, we know that the ancients
thought nothing was more pernicious
to a well regulated republic,
than to admit an <i>effeminate melody</i>:
it enervates men, unbending and
sensualizing their minds: languishing
and passionate tones please
only, by subjecting the soul to the
seducement of the senses, till it
becomes intoxicated by them. It
was on this account, that the magistrates
of Sparta broke all the
instruments, the harmony of which
was too delicate; and this was one
of the most important parts of their
policy. On the same account Plato
strictly forbids all the luxurious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>tones of the Asiatic music; and
christians, who ought never to pursue
pleasure only for the sake of
pleasure, are under much stronger
obligations to guard themselves
against these dangerous entertainments.</p>

<p>Poetry and music, <i>directed to their
true end</i>, may be of excellent use
to excite in the soul, lively and
sublime sentiments of virtue. How
many of the books of scripture of
the poetical kind, according to
all appearance were sung by the
Hebrews. Songs were the first
memorials which preserved more
distinctly, the tradition of divine
truths among men, before the invention
of writing. We see how
powerful music has been among
the heathen nations, in elevating
their minds above the sentiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>of the vulgar: and the church has
employed it,<a name="fnr_16" id="fnr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><sup><span class="small">16</span></sup></a> for the consolation
of her children, in celebrating the
praises of God. We ought not
therefore to abandon these arts,
which the spirit of God himself
hath consecrated.</p>

<p>Music and poetry employed on
sacred subjects, would have a powerful
influence in destroying the
relish for profane pleasures. But
while our present prejudices prevail,
these arts cannot be cultivated
without danger. Lose no time,
therefore, in making a young woman
who is strongly susceptible of
these impressions, sensible of what
charms may be found in music,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>even while it is confined to subjects
of religion: if she has a good voice
and a taste for music, never hope
to keep her in ignorance of it; to
forbid it will only increase her passion
for it. It will be much better
to give it a proper direction, than
to endeavour to stifle it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Painting</span> is more easily convertible
to good purposes; besides, it
belongs in some degree to women;
their needlework cannot properly
be executed without it. I know
they might be confined to employments
that are simple and require
no skill; but as I think we should
contrive to employ the head and
hands of women of condition at
the same time, I could wish they
had employments in which art
and ingenuity might season their
labours with some entertainment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>Their work cannot have any real
beauty, unless it be conducted by a
knowledge of the rules of drawing;
for want of which, what one sees
in stuffs, lace, and embroidery, is
done in an ill taste; all is confused;
without design, without proportion.<a name="fnr_17" id="fnr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><sup><span class="small">17</span></sup></a>
These things are reckoned
fine, because they cost a great deal
of labour to those who work them,
and a great deal of money to those
who buy them. The lustre dazzles
those who do not closely examine,
or are not skilful in these matters.
The women on this subject have
made rules of their own, which if
any man should contest, he would
be thought capricious and absurd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>However, they might correct themselves
by an attention to painting,
and so be able, at a moderate expense,
and to their great entertainment,
to execute works of a noble
variety and beauty, which would
bid defiance to the caprice and
uncertainty of fashion.</p>

<p>There is nothing which women
ought to guard more against, or
despise, than <i>living in idleness</i>. Let
them consider that the first christians
of whatever condition of life,
all applied themselves to some employment,
not as an amusement,
but as a serious, useful, constant
business. The order of nature,
the penance imposed on the first
man, and in him upon all his posterity,
the great example which our
Saviour Jesus Christ, hath set before
us in this respect, all concur to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>engage us, each in his station, to a
life of labour.</p>

<p>In the education of a young
woman, her condition ought to be
regarded, and the situation and cast
of life she will probably move in.
Take care that her expectations do
not exceed her fortune and rank;
if they do, they will cost her many
sorrows; what would have made
her happy, will become disgusting
to her, if she has cast a wishful
eye on a superior condition. If a
girl is to live in the country, turn
her attention betimes to the occupations
of the country; keep her
a stranger to the amusements of the
town: shew her the blessings of a
simple active life. If her situation
be among the middle ranks of the
town, let her not come near the
people of the court; this intercourse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>will only serve to give her unbecoming
and ridiculous airs: confine
her within the bounds of her own
station, and point out to her good
examples among those of the same
rank: form her mind to what will
be the business of her life: teach
her the management of a tradesman's
family: the care that ought
to be taken of his income, whether
from returns out of the country, or
rents of houses in the town: what
belongs to the education of her
children; in short the whole detail
of business or of commerce, into
which you foresee she may probably
be thrown, when she is married.<a name="fnr_18" id="fnr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><sup><span class="small">18</span></sup></a></p>

<h3><a name="ch_XIII" id="ch_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Of Governesses.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>I foresee that this plan of education,
will pass with many for a chimerical
project: it requires, they
will say, an uncommon share of
discernment, patience, and skill, to
carry it into execution: where are
the governesses capable of following,
or even understanding it? But
it should be considered that when
we are laying down rules for the
best education that can be given to
children, we are not to give imperfect
rules; it is not matter of
reprehension then, that in such an
enquiry, we aim at what is most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>perfect. It is true, we cannot go
so far in practice as our thoughts
go upon paper, where they meet
with no obstruction; but after all,
though we are absolutely unable to
arrive at perfection in this business,
it will be far from useless to know
what perfection is, and to attempt
it at any rate; which is the best
means of approaching it as nearly
as we can. Besides, my rules do
not proceed upon the supposition
of any thing extraordinary in the
disposition of children, or a concurrence
of circumstances happily
calculated for a perfect education;
on the contrary I endeavour to apply
remedies, to tempers naturally
bad, or which have been spoilt: I
calculate the common mistakes in
education, and have recourse to the
most simple methods of correcting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>in the whole or in part, what has
absolute need of correction.</p>

<p>It is true, you will not find in
this little work, the means of giving
success to an education neglected
or ill conducted; but is there any
thing strange in this? Is it not the
most that one can wish, to obtain
simple rules, by the observance of
which, a good education may be
acquired. I confess we may dispense,
and do dispense generally,
with much less than I propose; but
it is likewise very obvious that
children suffer materially by this
neglect. The road I am pointing
out, though tedious in appearance,
is in reality the shortest, as it leads
directly to the object we are in
pursuit of. The other, which is
that of <i>fear</i> and of a <i>superficial culture
of the understanding</i>, short as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>may seem, is in reality long; as it
hardly ever attains to the <i>only true
end of education</i>, which is to form the
mind, and inspire it with a sincere
love of virtue. The greater part
of those who have gone this latter
road, have to commence their journey
anew, at a moment when their
education seems finished; and after
having passed the first years of their
entrance into the world, in committing
errors which are often irreparable,
they are forced to learn
from experience, and their own reflections,
those maxims, of which
that wretched and superficial education
had left them in ignorance.
It should be observed moreover,
that the first services demanded in
behalf of children, and which inexperienced
people regard as oppressive
and impracticable, will preserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>them from troubles much more
grievous; and remove obstacles
which become insurmountable, in
the course of an education less
accurate and skilful.</p>

<p>Lastly it should be noticed that
in order to execute this plan of
education, the business does not
consist so much in doing any thing
which requires great talents, as in
avoiding the gross errors previously
enumerated. There will be often
nothing more wanting than to be
calm and patient with children: to
be watchful over them: to inspire
them with confidence: to give
plain and intelligible answers to
their little questions: to let their
natural dispositions work in order
to know them the better: and to
correct them with temper, when
they are mistaken, or in fault. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>is not reasonable to expect that a
good education can be conducted
by a bad governess; it is enough
to deliver rules which will give
success to one, moderately qualified:
of such a person it is not
expecting too much that she be
possessed of good sense, a mild
temper, and the fear of God; such
a one will find nothing in this
treatise subtile or abstracted, and if
she should not understand the
whole of it, she will comprehend
the substance at least; and that will
be sufficient. Make her read it
over many times, and be at the
trouble of reading it with her; allow
her the liberty of stopping you
at any thing she does not understand,
or of the truth of which she
is not convinced; then let her put
these instructions into practice, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>if you should observe, that in talking
to the child, she loses sight of
the rules which she had agreed to
follow, correct her privately in as
mild a manner as possible. This
application will be wearisome to
you at first, but if you are the father
or mother of the child, it is your
<i>indispensable</i> duty. Besides, your
difficulties will not be of long
continuance: your governess, if
she be sensible and well-disposed,
will learn more of your method in
a month by practice, than by long
arguments; and she will soon be
able to go on in the right way by
herself. There will be this further
circumstance to relieve you, that
she will find in this little work, the
principal topics of conversation,
with children, upon the most important
subjects already detailed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>her; so that she will hardly have
any thing to do but to follow them;
thus she will possess a collection
of the discourses she should hold
with children, upon subjects the
most difficult for them to understand;
it is a kind of practical education
which will be an easy guide
to her.</p>

<p>You may likewise make excellent
use of the <i>historical catechism</i> before-mentioned.
Let the person you
are forming to educate your children
read it over so often, that it
may be familiar to herself, and that
she may enter into the spirit of
this method of teaching. It must
be acknowledged, however, that
persons of even moderate talents
for such services, are rarely to be
met with; and yet nothing is to be
done in education, without a proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>instrument for the business; the
commonest things cannot be done
of themselves, and they are always
ill done by improper people.&mdash;Choose
therefore either out of
your own family, or among your
tenants, or friends, or from some
well-ordered society, some young
woman you think capable of being
taught: apply yourself early to the
forming of her for this employment:
have her near you for some
time, to make trial of her before
you commit to her so important a
trust. Five or six governesses
trained in this manner, would soon
be able to instruct a great number
of others; many of these would
probably fail, but out of a great
number, we might always repair
the loss, and not be so wretchedly
compelled, as we continually are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>to be seeking for a variety of
teachers.</p>

<p>But though the difficulty of finding
governesses is great; it must
be confessed there is another yet
greater, which is the <i>irregularity of
parents</i>. All the rest will signify
nothing, if <i>they</i> do not co-operate
in the business: the foundation of
every thing is giving their children
<i>right notions</i> and <i>edifying examples</i>:
and yet this is only to be found in
very few families; in most, one
sees nothing but confusion, perpetual
changes, a heap of servants,
who are not only quarreling with
one another, but are the cause of
disagreement among their masters
and mistresses. What a woeful
school is this for young children!
The mother who passes her time in
gaming, at plays, and in indiscreet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>conversations, very gravely complains
that she cannot find a governess
capable of bringing up her
children; but what good can the best
of educations confer on children,
with the example of such a mother
before them? One frequently sees
parents who themselves carry their
children to public diversions, and
other amusements,<a name="fnr_19" id="fnr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><sup><span class="small">19</span></sup></a> which cannot
fail of giving them a disrelish for
that serious and orderly course of
life, in which these very parents
wish to engage them: thus they
mix poison with wholesome diet:
they talk indeed of nothing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>discretion, but at the same time
they are agitating the flighty imagination
of their children, by the
violent impressions of music, and
of passionate theatrical representations,
which indispose them for
application, give them a taste for
what is passionate, and thereby
make them think <i>innocent</i> pleasure
<i>insipid</i>; and after all this still expect
that the business of education
shall go on well, and consider it as
an irksome and austere thing, if it
will not admit of <i>this mixture of
good or evil</i>. Thus are they fond
of the reputation of being anxious
for the good education of their
children, and yet are unwilling
to be at the pains of complying
with the most indispensable rules
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>Let us conclude with the picture
which the wise man has drawn of a
<i>virtuous woman</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="med">
<p>"Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is
far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely
trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. She
will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with
her hands. She is like the merchant ships, she bringeth
her food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet
night, and giveth meat to her household, and a proportion
to her maidens. She considereth a field, and
buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a
vineyard. She girdeth her loins with strength, and
strengtheneth her arms. She perceiveth that her merchandize
is good: her candle goeth not out by night.
She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold
the distaff. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;
yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. She is
not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
household are clothed with scarlet. She maketh herself
coverings of tapestry, her clothing is silk and purple.
Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth
among the elders of the land. She maketh fine linen,
and selleth it, and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
Strength and honour are her clothing, and she shall
rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with
wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She
looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth
not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and
call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou
excellest them all. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is
vain: but a woman that feareth the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, she shall be
praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her
own works praise her in the gates."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the great difference in
manners, and the brevity and boldness
of the figures, make this language
obscure at first, yet the stile is so
rich and animated, that we are soon
charmed with it on examination.
But what should be further remarked
in it, is, that it is the authority of
Solomon, the wisest of men; it is
the Holy Spirit itself speaking in
this lofty manner, to recommend to
us, in the character of a woman of
rank and fortune, <span class="smallcaps">simplicity of
manners</span>, <span class="smallcaps">domestic economy</span>
and <span class="smallcaps">industry</span>.</p>

<p class="med"><a name="fn_19" id="fn_19"></a><a href="#fnr_19">19.</a> I recommend the sensible mother, who has really
the happiness of her daughter at heart, to peruse and
reperuse the excellent observations on this head, which
are to be found in a little pamphlet, lately published by
the Rev. Mr. Owen; entitled "The Fashionable World
Displayed."</p>
